## Getting Started Locally

-   Install playwright extension for VSCode.
-   Copy `.env.dev.template` into `.env.dev` and fill in the values.
-   Run `yarn` to install dependencies. Make sure you're using node 18.x.
    `nvm install 18 && nvm use 18`.
-   Run tests directly from VSCode or from the command line with `yarn e2e`, or
    start the UI mode using `yarn e2e:ui` command. If you're using a local dev
    build, read the following section.
-   If you upgrade the version of Playwright, you'll need to run
    `yarn playwright install` to update the browser binaries.

### To use the local dev server of the app

-   This is useful if you want to run the tests against a local dev server of
    the app.
-   Set `export USE_DEV_BUILD=true` in `.env.dev` file.
-   Run `yarn devserver` to start the app dev server in a separate terminal
    window.
-   Proceed to run e2e tests as usual, from the CLI, VSCode, or Playwright UI.
-   **NOTE: Parallelization doesn't work with dev build.**

### Tips

1. Install the eslint extension. Also set `estlint.options` to
   `{"overrideConfigFile": ".eslintrc.js"}` in VSCode settings to get linting
   in the editor.

### Patterns

-   Use POMs where applicable, e.g. for pages, or for common components like
    grid, modal, sidebar.
-   Do not use assertion logic directly in POMs, instead use composition to
    create POMs that contain the assertion class.
-   Refrain from using `page.waitForTimeout()`. There is always a better
    alternative.

#### Check for flakiness

If you suspect a test is flaky, you can run it multiple times to see if it
fails consistently. In the following example, the test will be run 10 times and
a summary of the results will be printed describing how many times it passed
and how many times it failed.

You may either pass the name of the spec file or the test title.

```
yarn check-flaky -r 10 -s "video plays with correct label for each slice"
```

#### Template for POMs

```typescript
class MyPOM {
    readonly semanticLocator1: Locator;
    readonly semanticLocator2: Locator;
    readonly assert: MyPOMAsserter;

    constructor(private readonly page) {
        this.semanticLocator1 = this.page.locator("...");
        this.semanticLocator2 = this.page.locator("...");
        this.assert = new MyPOMAsserter(this);
    }

    /**
     * All methods that return static locators should be decorated with `get`.
     */
    get someElement() {
        return this.page.locator("...");
    }

    /**
     * All methods that return dynamic locators should be prefixed with `get`.
     */
    getMyElement(param: string) {
        return this.page.locator(`...${param}...`);
    }

    /**
     * All actions should be verbs or prefixed with a verb.
     */
    async doSomeAction() {
        await this.someElement.click();
    }
}

class MyPOMAsserter {
    constructor(private readonly myPOM: MyPOM) {}

    async isFooVisible() {
        await expect(this.myPOM.someElement).toBeVisible();
    }
}
```

#### Screenshot Testing

1. Read [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots) on this
   subject.
2. Since baseline screenshots are platform dependent, and our CI server runs on
   linux, to generate linux screenshots locally, run the following commands:

```
# create a docker image with playwright and python and fiftyone
yarn build-linux-screenshot-docker-image

# make sure mongod is running and available in your host machine at localhost:27017

# generate screenshots
# from e2e-pw directory, run:
docker run --rm --network host -v $(pwd):/work/ -w /work/ -it screenshot /bin/bash

# inside the docker container, run:
# if playwright version was updated,
npx playwright install chromium

. /e2e/venv/bin/activate
npx playwright test --update-snapshots -g "description of my test"
```

### Known Issues

#### Browser / Target has been closed

-   Most likely a missing `await` somewhere. Use VSCode eslint integration to
    get hints on missing `await`s.

#### Error: No tests found

-   This shows up randomly when running tests from VSCode. Run "Developer:
    Reload Window" to fix it.

#### Troubleshooting

The order of the steps is from the most to the least likely to fix the issue.

-   Run `yarn kill-port 8787` to kill any stray processes that might be running
    on port 8787.
-   Reload VSCode developer window.
-   Close all browser windows from previous test runs.
-   Restart the dev server.
