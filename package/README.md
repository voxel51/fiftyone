# FiftyOne Packaging

This folder contains supporting code to package most sub-packages of FiftyOne.
FiftyOne packages are distributed as [wheels](https://pythonwheels.com/)
installable with `pip`.

For each package, `python setup.py bdist_wheel` will generate a wheel for the
current platform. For some packages, this is configurable as detailed below.

## Packaging `fiftyone`

The wheel for this package will work on any supported platform and Python
version - no extra steps are necessary.

The `fiftyone` wheel works on any platform. The `fiftyone-brain` wheel
currently must be built on the target platform.

## Packaging `fiftyone-brain`

The wheel for this package is tied to a specific platform and Python version.
By default, it will be built for your current platform - to change this, add
`--plat-name linux`, `--plat-name mac`, or `--plat-name win` to the
`bdist_wheel` command above. (The build process will replace these names with
the proper platform names recognized by `pip`.)

Building for separate Python versions currently must be done manually, e.g. by
creating separate virtual environments. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
is one way to install multiple isolated Python versions.

## Packaging `fiftyone-db`

This package can be built from within the `package/db` directory. The wheel for
this package is platform-specific but will work with any supported Python
version. To target a platform other than your current one, add
`--plat-name mac` or `--plat-name linux` to the `bdist_wheel` command.

As part of the build process, MongoDB is downloaded and cached in
`package/db/cache`. If you have already downloaded MongoDB and would like to
avoid a second download, you can copy the archive here - refer to
`package/db/setup.py` for the expected filename (which should match the
download URL).

## Packaging `fiftyone-gui`

This package supports the same platforms as `fiftyone-db` and the same
portability constraints apply. It can be built from within the `package/gui`
directory.

Before building this package, you need to have built a native Electron app for
your target platform. To do this, switch to the `electron` folder and run
`yarn package-linux` or `yarn package-mac`. This may take several minutes to
complete, and may require additional system packages - see
[this page](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for details. Once
the Electron app is built, switch to the `package/gui` folder and build a wheel
using the above instructions.

## Testing with built wheels locally

Once you have built the wheels you want to test with, you can simply run
`pip install /path/to/dist/fiftyone-something.whl` in a separate environment to
install them manually. Note that the main `fiftyone` package currently depends
on the other packages, so they will need to be installed first.

If you are reinstalling wheels frequently for testing purposes, adding
`--force-reinstall` to `pip install` will force reinstallation, and `--no-deps`
will skip reinstalling dependencies.

## Testing package uploads locally

You can spin up a local PyPI server instance (in this example, accessible at
`localhost:5159`) with:

```
cd package/pypi-server/local
chmod a+w packages
docker-compose up -d
```

Note that this instance (as well as the command with `-a . -P .` below) allows
**unauthenticated uploads**, so do not use this in production!

An alternative `docker` command if you don't have `docker-compose` installed:

```
docker run --rm -d -p 5159:8080 pypiserver/pypiserver:latest -a . -P . /data/packages
```

In this case, if you want to save packages across runs, you can bind
`/data/packages` in the container to a local folder by adding
`-v /path/to/local/folder:/data/packages` before `pypiserver/pypiserver:latest`
in the above command. Note that this folder's permissions need to be set
properly (`chmod a+w`) or you will run into 500 server errors when uploading
packages.

Before uploading packages to this instance, create `~/.pypirc` with:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    local

[local]
repository: http://localhost:5159
username:
password:
```

If you have a `~/.pypirc` file already, add the `[local]` section and `local`
under `index-servers`. The `local` name can be changed as long as you are
consistent.

To upload a package to this instance, run the following command in the folder
where you built the package. Note that this uses
[`twine`](https://pypi.org/project/twine/), which is installed as a dev
requirement in this project.

```
twine upload -r local dist/*.whl
```

You can also explicitly pass the paths of one or more wheels to `twine upload`
if there are some that you don't want to upload.

To download packages from this instance, add `--index http://localhost:5159` to
`pip install`. (If your instance is on another host and is not HTTPS-enabled,
you will need to add `--trusted-host <hostname>` as well.)
