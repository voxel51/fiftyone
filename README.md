### 1. Install Python and Git

#### 1.1 Install Python

**Note:** ‚ö†Ô∏è The version of Python that is available in the Microsoft Store is **not recommended**. 

Download a Python installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Choose Python **3.9**, **3.10**, or **3.11** and make sure to pick a **64-bit** version. For example, this [Python 3.10.11 installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe).
Double-click on the installer to run it, and follow the steps in the installer.
  - **Check the box to add Python to your PATH**, and to install py.
  - At the end of the installer, there is an option to **disable the PATH length limit**. It is recommended to click this.

#### 1.2 Install Git

Download Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
Double-click on the installer to run it, and follow the steps in the installer.

### 2. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and FFMPEG (Optional)

Download [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).
Double-click on the installer to run it, and follow the steps in the installer.

#### Install FFMPEG

Download FFMPEG binary from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
Set FFMPEG's path (e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin) to the PATH environmental variable on Windows.

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

- Press `Win + R`. type `cmd`, and press `Enter`. Alternatively, search **Command Prompt** in the Start Menu.
- Navigate to your project. ` cd C:\path\to\your\project`
- Create the environment `python -m venv fiftyone_env`
- Activate the environment typing this in the command line window `fiftyone_env\Scripts\activate`
- After activation, your command prompt should change and show the name of the virtual environment `(fiftyon_env) C:\path\to\your\project`
- Now you are ready to install **Fiftyone** and all the requirements/packages/dependencies. Go to [Installation](#-installation) section in this Readme file.

**Fiftyone** provides two ways for being installed. The first one is through PyPI, and the second is through a local installation. PyPI is the straight forward installation method if you are not looking for any changes in the source code, if you want to make changes to the source code, then a local installation is recommended.

We strongly recommend that you install FiftyOne in a
[virtual environment](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/getting_started/virtualenv.html)
to maintain a clean workspace. Refer to prerequisites if you want to learn how to create a new virtual environment in your machine.

<details>
<summary>Install from PyPI</summary>
Installing the library with pip is the easiest way to get started with fiftyone. You can install the latest stable version of FiftyOne via `pip`:

```shell
pip install fiftyone
```

Consult the
[installation guide](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/getting_started/install.html)
for troubleshooting and other information about getting up-and-running with
FiftyOne.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install from source</summary>

To install from source, you need to clone the repository and install the library using pip via editable mode. The instructions below are for macOS and Linux systems. Windows users may need
to make adjustments. If you are working in Google Colab, [skip to here](#source-installs-in-google-colab).

First, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone
cd fiftyone
```

Then run the install script:

```shell
# Mac or Linux
bash install.bash

# Windows
.\install.bat
```

**NOTE:** If you run into issues importing FiftyOne, you may need to add the
path to the cloned repository to your `PYTHONPATH`:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/fiftyone
```

**NOTE:** The install script adds to your `nvm` settings in your `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.bash_profile`, which is needed for installing and building the App

**NOTE:** When you pull in new changes to the App, you will need to rebuild it,
which you can do either by rerunning the install script or just running
`yarn build` in the `./app` directory.

### Upgrading your source installation

To upgrade an existing source installation to the bleeding edge, simply pull
the latest `develop` branch and rerun the install script:

```shell
git checkout develop
git pull
bash install.bash
```

### Developer installation

If you would like to
[contribute to FiftyOne](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md),
you should perform a developer installation using the `-d` flag of the install
script:

```shell
# Mac or Linux
bash install.bash -d

# Windows
.\install.bat -d
```

Although not required, developers typically prefer to configure their FiftyOne
installation to connect to a self-installed and managed instance of MongoDB,
which you can do by following
[these simple steps](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/config.html#configuring-a-mongodb-connection).

### Source installs in Google Colab

You can install from source in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by running the following in a
cell and then **restarting the runtime**:

```shell
%%shell

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone.git
cd fiftyone

# Mac or Linux
bash install.bash

# Windows
.\install.bat
```

### Generating documentation

See the
[docs guide](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/docs/README.md)
for information on building and contributing to the documentation.

### Uninstallation

You can uninstall FiftyOne as follows:

```shell
pip uninstall fiftyone fiftyone-brain fiftyone-db
```

Dive right into FiftyOne by opening a Python shell and running the snippet
below, which downloads a
[small dataset](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#quickstart)
and launches the
[FiftyOne App](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html) so you
can explore it:

```py
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
```

Then check out
[this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/voxel51/fiftyone-examples/blob/master/examples/quickstart.ipynb)
to see some common workflows on the quickstart dataset.

Note that if you are running the above code in a script, you must include
`session.wait()` to block execution until you close the App. See
[this page](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html#creating-a-session)
for more information.
