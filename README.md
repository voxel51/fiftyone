Nothing hinders the success of machine learning systems more than poor quality
data. And without the right tools, improving a model can be time-consuming and
inefficient.

[FiftyOne](https://fiftyone.ai) supercharges your machine learning workflows by
enabling you to visualize datasets and interpret models faster and more
effectively.

Use FiftyOne to get hands-on with your data, including visualizing complex
labels, evaluating your models, exploring scenarios of interest, identifying
failure modes, finding annotation mistakes, and much more!

You can get involved by joining our Slack community, reading our blog on
Medium, and following us on social media:

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of FiftyOne via `pip`:

```shell
pip install fiftyone
```

Consult the
[installation guide](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/getting_started/install.html)
for troubleshooting and other information about getting up-and-running with
FiftyOne.

## Quickstart

Dive right into FiftyOne by opening a Python shell and running the snippet
below, which downloads a
[small dataset](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#quickstart)
and launches the
[FiftyOne App](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html) so you
can explore it:

```py
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
```

Then check out
[this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/voxel51/fiftyone-examples/blob/master/examples/quickstart.ipynb)
to see some common workflows on the quickstart dataset.

Note that if you are running the above code in a script, you must include
`session.wait()` to block execution until you close the App. See
[this page](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html#creating-a-session)
for more information.

## Documentation

Full documentation for FiftyOne is available at
[fiftyone.ai](https://fiftyone.ai). In particular, see these resources:

-   [Tutorials](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/tutorials/index.html)
-   [Recipes](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/recipes/index.html)

## Examples

Check out the [fiftyone-examples](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-examples)
repository for open source and community-contributed examples of using
FiftyOne.

## Contributing to FiftyOne

FiftyOne is open source and community contributions are welcome!

Check out the
[contribution guide](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to learn how to get involved.

## Installing from source

The instructions below are for macOS and Linux systems. Windows users may need
to make adjustments. If you are working in Google Colab,
[skip to here](#source-installs-in-google-colab).

### Prerequisites

You will need:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org) (3.7 or newer)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - on Linux, we recommend using
    [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install an up-to-date version.
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - once Node.js is installed, you can install
    Yarn via `npm install -g yarn`
-   On Linux, you will need at least the `openssl` and `libcurl` packages. On
    Debian-based distributions, you will need to install `libcurl4` or
    `libcurl3` instead of `libcurl`, depending on the age of your distribution.
    For example:

```shell
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install libcurl4 openssl

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libcurl openssl
```

### Installation

We strongly recommend that you install FiftyOne in a
[virtual environment](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/getting_started/virtualenv.html)
to maintain a clean workspace. The install script is only supported in
POSIX-based systems (e.g. Mac and Linux).

First, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone
cd fiftyone
```

Then run the install script:

```shell
bash install.bash
```

**NOTE:** If you run into issues importing FiftyOne, you may need to add the
path to the cloned repository to your `PYTHONPATH`:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/fiftyone
```

**NOTE:** The install script adds to your `nvm` settings in your `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.bash_profile`, which is needed for installing and building the App

**NOTE:** When you pull in new changes to the App, you will need to rebuild it,
which you can do either by rerunning the install script or just running
`yarn build` in the `./app` directory.

### Upgrading your source installation

To upgrade an existing source installation to the bleeding edge, simply pull
the latest `develop` branch and rerun the install script:

```shell
git checkout develop
git pull
bash install.bash
```

### Developer installation

If you would like to
[contribute to FiftyOne](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md),
you should perform a developer installation using the `-d` flag of the install
script:

```shell
bash install.bash -d
```

### Source installs in Google Colab

You can install from source in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by running the following in a
cell and then **restarting the runtime**:

```shell
%%shell

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone.git
cd fiftyone
bash install.bash
```

### Docker installs

Refer to
[these instructions](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/environments/index.html#docker)
to see how to build and run Docker images containing source or release builds
of FiftyOne.

### UI Development on Storybook

Voxel51 is currently in the process of implementing a
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which contains examples of its basic UI
components. You can access the current storybook instances by running **yarn
storybook** in **/app/packages/components**. While the storybook instance is
running, any changes to the component will trigger a refresh in the storybook
app.

```shell
%%shell

cd /app/packages/components
yarn storybook
```

### Generating documentation

See the
[docs guide](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/docs/README.md)
for information on building and contributing to the documentation.

## Uninstallation

You can uninstall FiftyOne as follows:

```shell
pip uninstall fiftyone fiftyone-brain fiftyone-db fiftyone-desktop
```
