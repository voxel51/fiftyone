# Image Deduplication with FiftyOne

This example demonstrates a simple use case of using FiftyOne to detect and
remove duplicate images from your dataset.

## Download the data

First we download the dataset to disk. The dataset is a 1000 sample subset of
CIFAR-100, a dataset of 32x32 pixel images with one of 100 different
classification labels such as `apple`, `bicycle`, `porcupine`, etc.

```bash
python -m fiftyone.examples.image_deduplication.download_dataset
```

The above script uses `tensorflow.keras.datasets` to download the dataset, so
you must have [TensorFlow installed](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

The dataset is organized on disk as follows:

```
/tmp/fiftyone/
└── cifar100_with_duplicates/
    ├── <classA>/
    │   ├── <image1>.jpg
    │   ├── <image2>.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── <classB>/
    │   ├── <image1>.jpg
    │   ├── <image2>.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

As we will soon come to discover, some of these samples are duplicates and we
have no clue which they are!

## Import FiftyOne

Importing the main FiftyOne package is easy:

```py
import fiftyone as fo
```

## Create a dataset

Let's use a utililty method provided by FiftyOne to load the image
classification dataset from disk:

```py
import os

import fiftyone.utils.data as foud

dataset_name = "cifar100_with_duplicates"

src_data_dir = os.path.join("/tmp/fiftyone", dataset_name)

samples, classes = foud.parse_image_classification_dir_tree(src_data_dir)
dataset = fo.Dataset.from_image_classification_samples(
    samples, name=dataset_name, classes=classes
)
```

## Explore the dataset

We can poke around in the dataset:

```py
# Print summary information about the dataset
print(dataset)

# Print a random sample
print(dataset.view().take(1).first())
```

Create a view that contains only samples whose ground truth label is
`mountain`:

```py
view = dataset.view().match({"ground_truth.label": "mountain"})

# Print summary information about the view
print(view)

# Print the first sample in the view
print(view.first())
```

Create a view with samples sorted by their ground truth labels in reverse
alphabetical order:

```py
view = dataset.view().sort_by("ground_truth.label", reverse=True)

print(view)
print(view.first())
```

## Visualize the dataset

Start browsing the dataset:

```py
session = fo.launch_dashboard(dataset=dataset)
```

Narrow your scope to 10 random samples:

```py
session.view = dataset.view().take(10)
```

Click on some some samples in the GUI to select them and access their IDs from
code!

```py
# Get the IDs of the currently selected samples in the dashboard
sample_ids = session.selected
```

Create a view that contains your currently selected samples:

```py
selected_view = dataset.view().select(session.selected)
```

Update the dashboard to only show your selected samples:

```py
session.view = selected_view
```

## Compute file hashes

Iterate over the samples and compute their file hashes:

```py
import fiftyone.core.utils as fou

for sample in dataset:
    sample["file_hash"] = fou.compute_filehash(sample.filepath)
    sample.save()

print(dataset)
```

We have two ways to visualize this new information:

-   From your terminal:

```py
sample = dataset.view().first()
print(sample)
```

-   By refreshing the dashboard:

```py
session.dataset = dataset
```

## Check for duplicates

Now let's use a simple Python statement to locate the duplicate files in the
dataset, i.e., those with the same file hashses:

```py
from collections import Counter

filehash_counts = Counter(sample.file_hash for sample in dataset)
dup_filehashes = [k for k, v in filehash_counts.items() if v > 1]

print("Number of duplicate file hashes: %d" % len(dup_filehashes))
```

Now let's create a view that contains only the samples with these duplicate
file hashes:

```py
dup_view = (
    dataset.view()
    # Extract samples with duplicate file hashes
    .match({"file_hash": {"$in": dup_filehashes}})
    # Sort by file hash so duplicates will be adjacent
    .sort_by("file_hash")
)

print("Number of images that have a duplicate: %d" % len(dup_view))
print("Number of duplicates: %d" % (len(dup_view) - len(dup_filehashes)))
```

Of course, we can always use the dashboard to visualize our work!

```py
session.view = dup_view
```

## Delete duplicates

Now let's delete the duplicate samples from the dataset using our `dup_view` to
restrict our attention to known duplicates:

```py
print("Length of dataset before: %d" % len(dataset))

_dup_filehashes = set()
for sample in dup_view:
    if sample.file_hash not in _dup_filehashes:
        _dup_filehashes.add(sample.file_hash)
        continue

    del dataset[sample.id]

print("Length of dataset after: %d" % len(dataset))

# Verify that the dataset no longer contains any duplicates
print("Number of unique file hashes: %d" % len({s.file_hash for s in dataset}))
```

## Export the deduplicated dataset

Finally, let's export a fresh copy of our now-duplicate-free dataset:

```py
EXPORT_DIR = "/tmp/fiftyone/export"

dataset.export(label_field="ground_truth", export_dir=EXPORT_DIR)
```

Check out the contents of `/tmp/fiftyone/export` on disk to see how the data is
organized.

You can load the deduplicated dataset that you exported back into FiftyOne at
any time as follows:

```py
no_dups_dataset = fo.Dataset.from_image_classification_dataset(
    EXPORT_DIR, name="no_duplicates"
)

print(no_dups_dataset)
```

## Cleanup

You can cleanup the files generated by this tutorial by running:

```shell
rm -rf /tmp/fiftyone
```
