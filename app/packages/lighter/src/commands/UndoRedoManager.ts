/**
 * Manages undo/redo operations using the Command Pattern.
 *
 * This implementation follows the Command design pattern where each user action
 * is encapsulated as a Command object that implements both execute() and undo()
 * methods. The UndoRedoManager maintains two stacks:
 *
 * - undoStack: Contains executed commands that can be undone
 * - redoStack: Contains undone commands that can be redone
 *
 * When a new command is executed:
 * 1. The command is pushed onto the undoStack
 * 2. The redoStack is cleared (since a new action invalidates the redo history)
 *
 * When undo is called:
 * 1. The last command is popped from undoStack
 * 2. The command's undo() method is called
 * 3. The command is pushed onto redoStack
 *
 * When redo is called:
 * 1. The last command is popped from redoStack
 * 2. The command's execute() method is called
 * 3. The command is pushed onto undoStack
