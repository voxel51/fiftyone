# Contributing to the FiftyOne App

Help wanted! This document describes best practices for contributing to the
FiftyOne App codebase.

## Best Practices

-   All React components should be function-based, not class-based
-   We recommend writing fully typed TypeScript, although we are still
    transitioning
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for autoformatting CSS,
    TypeScript, YAML, Markdown, etc. Installing FiftyOne with the development
    flag (`-d`) should have installed this step as a pre-commit hook

## Getting started

See the App's [README.md](README.md) for installation instructions.
