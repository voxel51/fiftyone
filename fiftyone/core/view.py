class DatasetView(foc.SampleCollection):
    """A view into a :class:`fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset`.

    Dataset views represent ordered collections of subsets of samples in a
    dataset.

    Operations on dataset views are designed to be chained together to yield
    the desired subset of the dataset, which is then iterated over to directly
    access the sample views. Each stage in the pipeline defining a dataset view
    is represented by a :class:`fiftyone.core.stages.ViewStage` instance.

    The stages of a dataset view specify:

    -   The subset of samples (and their order) that should be included
    -   The possibly-filtered fields of each sample that should be included

    Samples retrieved from dataset views are returned as
    :class:`fiftyone.core.sample.SampleView` objects, as opposed to
    :class:`fiftyone.core.sample.Sample` objects, since they may contain a
    subset of the sample's content.

    See :ref:`this page <using-views>` for an overview of working with dataset
    views.
