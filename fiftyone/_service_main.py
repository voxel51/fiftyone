"""
This script provides a consistent environment for services to run in. The basic
architecture is:

- parent process (python, ipython, etc.)
    - this process, referred to as the "current" process (_service_main.py)
        - child process (the service)
            - (optional): any child processes that the service creates

Some services that we spin up do not terminate on their own when their parent
process terminates, so they need to be killed explicitly. However, if the
parent process is a Python interpreter that is in the process of shutting down,
it cannot reliably kill its children. This script works around these issues by
detecting when the parent process exits, terminating its children, and only
then exiting itself.
