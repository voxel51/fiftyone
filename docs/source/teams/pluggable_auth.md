# Pluggable Authentication

FiftyOne Teams v1.6.0 introduces Pluggable Authentication that provides the
Central Authentication Service (CAS). CAS is a self-contained authentication
system with two modes (`legacy` and `internal`). Legacy mode uses Auth0.
Internal mode eliminates the Auth0 external dependency and may run in
environments without egress to the internet. CAS provides a UI, REST API, and
JavaScript (JS) Hook mechanism to manage FiftyOne Teams user data and
authentication.

## FiftyOne Authentication Modes

The setting `FIFTYONE_AUTH_MODE` specifies the authentication mode `legacy` or
`internal`.

(legacy-mode)=

### Legacy Mode

In legacy mode, FiftyOne Teams uses Auth0 for user authentication and
authorization. This mode requires an external connection to Auth0 endpoints.
User data is eventually consistent (where changes are reflected across
FiftyOneTeams eventually). Auth0 contains the configuration for identity
providers and the persistence of user data. Auth0 supports multiple providers
(including SAML). For the supported IdPs, see
[Auth0 Enterprise Identity Providers](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers).

(internal-mode)=

### Internal Mode

In internal mode, FiftyOne Teams the CAS replaces Auth0. FiftyOne Teams will
not require network egress to external services. User data is immediately
consistent (where changes are reflected across FiftyOne Teams instantly).
Directory data is immediately written to MongoDB, and organizations have the
autonomy to manage their Identity Provider Configuration. Internal mode
supports
[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/discover-openid-and-openid-connect/)
and [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

> **NOTE**: SAML is not supported in [internal mode](#internal-mode)

<!-- TODO: Enumerate what connection types are supported. -->

> NOTE: invitations to onboard users are not supported in internal mode.

## Super Admin UI

![Super Admin UI](/images/teams/cas/cas_api_docs.png)

The Super Admin UI contains FiftyOne Teams deployment wide configurations. When
logging into FiftyOne Teams as an admin, you are in the context of an
organization. Settings are scoped by organization and only apply to that
organization. The Super Admin UI allows you to administer all organizations and
global configurations (Identity Providers, Session timeouts, and JS hooks).

> **NOTE**: In v1.6.0, the Super Admin UI is only available in
> [internal mode](#internal-mode)

![Sign In to CAS](/images/teams/cas/cas_sign_in.png)

To login to this application navigate to
`https://<YOUR_FIFTYONE_TEAMS_URL>/cas/configurations`. In the top right of the
screen, and provide the `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET` to login.

> **NOTE**: The value of `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET` should be set prior to
> installation or upgrade.

(identity-providers)=

## Identity Providers (IdP)

In [internal mode](#internal-mode), use the CAS REST API or Super Admin UI to
configure FiftyOne teams to authenticate users via OIDC or OAuth2 compatible
Identity Providers. Below is an example configuration for KeyCloak as an
Identity Provider.

```json
{
    "id": "keycloak-example",
    "wellKnown": "https://keycloak.dev.acme.ai/auth/realms/acme/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "name": "KeyCloak",
    "type": "oauth",
    "authorization": {
        "url": "https://keycloak.acme.ai/auth/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/auth",
        "params": {
            "scope": "openid email profile"
        }
    },
    "clientId": "...",
    "clientSecret": "...",
    "issuer": "https://keycloak.dev.acme.ai/auth/realms/acme",
    "token": {
        "url": "https://keycloak.dev.acme.ai/auth/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/token"
    },
    "userinfo": {
        "url": "https://keycloak.dev.acme.ai/auth/realms/acme/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo"
    },
    "idToken": true,
    "style": {
        "logoDark": "https://images.com/keycloak.svg",
        "bg": "#47abc6",
        "text": "#fff"
    },
    "profile": "(e,l)=>(console.log({profile:e,tokens:l}),{id:e.sub,name:e.name,email:e.email,image:null})",
    "allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking": true
}
```

<!--
**Migrating from Legacy to internal mode**

The migration from Legacy to internal mode begins with configuring an
authentication provider through CAS (UI or REST). Following this, all existing
user data must be migrated from Auth0, utilizing the management SDK or Auth0
API to ensure a comprehensive transfer of information.

For each user, the migration involves several steps:

1. Creating a FiftyOne Teams user profile via `POST /cas/api/users`.
1. Assigning the user to the default organization through a membership entry.
1. Linking the user's account to the new authentication provider by creating an
   account reference via `POST /cas/api/accounts`.

The final step in the migration involves changing the `FIFTYONE_AUTH_MODE`
setting from legacy to internal. This change officially activates Internal
Mode, completing the migration process.
-->

## Getting Started with Internal Mode

These steps are only required to run FiftyOne Teams in
[internal mode](#internal-mode). Please skip when using Auth0 in
[legacy mode](#legacy-mode).

1. Configure your Identity Provider
1. Login to the SuperUser UI by navigating to
   `https://<YOUR_FIFTYONE_TEAMS_URL>/cas/configurations` and in the top right,
   and provide the `FIFTYONE_AUTH_SECRET` to login.
1. Create an Admin
    1. Click on the “Admins” tab
    1. Click “Add admin” in the bottom left
    1. Set the name and email address (as it appears in your Identity Provider)
       and click “Add”
1. Add your Identity Provider
    1. Click on the “Identity Providers” tab at the top of the screen and click
       “Add provider”
    1. Fill out the “Add identity provider”
        1. You can also click “Switch to advanced editor” to provide the full
           configuration as a JSON object
    1. In the “Profile callback” field, set the mapping that your Identity
       Provider expects
1. Login with the admin user
    1. Navigate to `https://<YOUR_FIFTYONE_TEAMS_URL>/datasets`
    1. You should see the login screen for your newly configured authentication
       provider
    1. Before logging in, set the admin user (in step 5). Otherwise, you will
       need to remove this user from the database and try again.
    1. Click the login button and provide the credentials of the Admin user
       (set in step 3)
    1. Click on the icon in the top right corner then click “Settings”
    1. Click “Users” on the left side
    1. Validate the user is listed as an admin

## Syncing with 3rd Party Directories (Open Directory, LDAP, and Active Directory)

Below is an example of how to use JavaScript hooks to sync FiftyOne Teams with
a corporate directory (such as Open Directory, LDAP, or Active Directory) via
an intermediary REST API or Identity Provider. The recommended setup is with
OAuth/OIDC claims, however the example below illustrates a more intricate
integration.

This example specifically addresses a scenario in which additional actions are
performed during the `signIn` trigger. This demonstrates how hooks can extend
beyond simple authentication to interact with external APIs and internal
services for complex user management and group assignment tasks. Here's a
breakdown of the example:

```typescript
// Example JavaScript hook implementation
async function Hook(context) {
    const { params, services, trigger } = context;
    const { user } = params;

    switch (trigger) {
        // Callback: user is trying to sign in
        case "signIn":
            // returning false will prevent user from signing in
            try {
                const groups = await getGroups();
                for (const group of groups) {
                    await addUserToGroup(group.name);
                }
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
            return true;
    }

    async function getGroups() {
        const { account } = params;
        const response = await services.util.http.get(
            `https://fiftyone.ai/list_groups/${user.id}`,
            { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${account?.access_token}` } }
        );
        return response.json();
    }

    async function addUserToGroup(groupName) {
        const orgId = "my_org_id";
        // Retrieve all existing groups
        const groups = await services.directory.groups.listGroups(orgId);
        // Find an existing group by name
        let group = groups.find((group) => {
            return group.name === groupName;
        });
        // If group does not exist, create a new group
        if (!group) {
            group = await services.directory.groups.createGroup(
                orgId,
                groupName
            );
        }

        if (!group.userIds.includes(user.id)) {
            // Add signed-in user to the group and update the group
            const updatedGroupName = undefined;
            const updatedGroupDescription = undefined;
            const updatedGroupUserIds = [...group.userIds, user.id];
            const accessorId = undefined;
            await services.directory.groups.updateGroup(
                orgId,
                group.id,
                accessorId,
                updatedGroupName,
                updatedGroupDescription,
                updatedGroupUserIds
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### **Context Object**

The context object provides information about the current operation, including
parameters like the user's details, and services (services) that offer utility
functions and access to directory operations.

### **External API Integration**

-   `getGroups`: This function calls an external API to retrieve a list of
    groups to which the signing-in user should be added. It utilizes the
    `services.util.http.get` method for making the HTTP request, demonstrating
    how external services can be queried within the hook.
-   `addUserToGroup`: For each group retrieved from the external API, this
    function checks if the group exists in the organization's directory. If a
    group does not exist, it is created, and then the user is added to it. This
    process involves querying and modifying the organization's group directory,
    illustrating the hook's capability to perform complex operations like
    dynamic group management based on external data.

### Error Handling

-   The try-catch block around the external API call and group manipulation
    logic ensures that errors do not prevent the user from signing in but are
    properly logged

### Summary

This hook example demonstrates a pattern for extending authentication flows in
CAS with custom logic. By integrating with an external API to fetch group
information and manipulating the organization's group memberships accordingly,
it showcases the flexibility and extensibility of hooks in supporting complex,
real-world authentication and authorization scenarios.

## JavaScript Hooks

This documentation outlines the JavaScript hook implementation for the Central
Authentication Service (CAS). As a CAS superuser, you are able to define
JavaScript functions that integrate with various authentication flows within
CAS, customizing the authentication processes.

### Overview

JavaScript hooks allow superusers to programmatically influence authentication
flows, including sign-in, sign-up, JWT handling and customization, redirection,
and session management. This document describes the available hooks, their
triggers, expected return types, and contextual information provided to each
hook.

### Example JavaScript Hook

```typescript
// Example JavaScript hook implementation
async function Hook(context) {
    const { params, services, trigger } = context;

    switch (trigger) {
        // user is trying to sign in
        case "signIn":
            // returning false will prevent user from signing in
            return true;

        // JWT token is created for user session
        case "jwt":
            // custom payload returned will be merged with default payload
            return {};

        // user has logged out
        case "logout":
            // returning or throwing here does not affect the sign out flow
            break;

        // user is being redirected on sign in our sign out
        case "redirect":
            // user will be redirected to this URL on sign in our sign out
            return "/settings/accounts";
    }
}
```
