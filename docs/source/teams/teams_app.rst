FiftyOne Teams App
==================

.. default-role:: code

The FiftyOne Teams App allows you to visualize, browse, and interact with your
individual datasets like you can with the :ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>`,
but with expanded features for organizing, permissionsing, versioning, and
sharing your team's datasets, all from a centralized web portal.

This page provides a brief overview of some features available only in the
FiftyOne Teams App.

.. _teams-homepage:

The homepage
____________

When you login to the FiftyOne Teams App, you'll land on the homepage pictured
below.

In the top bar of this page, on the left side, the gray number next to
"All datasets" indicates the total number of datasets that you have access to.
If there are more than 20 datasets, you can use the "Previous" and "Next"
buttons at the bottom of the page to see different batches of datasets.

.. note::

   You can return to the homepage from any page of the Teams App by clicking on
   the Voxel51 logo in the upper left corner.

.. _teams-pinned-datasets:

Pinned datasets
---------------

You can pin datasets for easy access by hovering over the dataset's name in
the main table and clicking the pin icon.

The "Your pinned datasets" widget on the right-hand side of the hompage shows
your pinned datasets at a glance and allows you to quickly open one by
clicking on its name. Pinned datasets are listed in reverse chronological order
(most recently pinned on top).

To unpin a dataset, click the pin icon next to the dataset name in the "Your
pinned datasets" widget or the pin next to the dataset's name in the main
table.

.. _teams-sorting-datasets:

Sorting datasets
----------------

You can use the drop-down menu in the upper left of the main table to sort your
datasets by various criteria, including size, creation date, recently used, and
alphabetically by name:

.. _teams-filtering-datasets:

Filtering datasets
------------------

You can use the search bar (with the magnifying glass icon) in the upper right
corner of the dataset table to filter datasets by name, tags, and media type:

By default, datasets that match across any supported field are returned, but
you can narrow the search to specific fields by selecting the relevant option
in the search dropdown:

.. _teams-creating-datasets:

Creating datasets
_________________

To create a new dataset, click on the "New dataset" button in the upper right
corner of the homepage. A pop-up will appear allowing you to choose a name,
description, and tags for the dataset:

*  **Name**: as youâ€™re typing a name for your dataset, a URL will appear below
   denoting the address at which the dataset will be accessible. If the name or
   URL is not available, you will be prompted to try another name.

*  **Description**: an optional free text description that you can use to store
   relevant information about your dataset.

*  **Tags**: an optional list of tag(s) for your dataset. For example, you may
   want to record the media type, task type, project name, or other pertinent
   information. To add a tag, type it in the text bar. If you have previously
   used a tag, it will automatically appear in a dropdown and you can select
   it. To add a new tag, type tab or comma.

.. note::

   A dataset's name, description, and tags can be edited later from the
   dataset's :ref:`Manage tab <teams-managing-datasets>`.

   :align: center

.. note::

   What next? Use the :ref:`Teams Python SDK <teams-python-sdk>` to upload new
   samples, labels, and metadata to your dataset. A common approach is to
   automate this process via :ref:`cloud functions <teams-cloud-functions>`.

.. _teams-using-datasets:

Using a dataset
_______________

Click on a dataset from the homepage to open the dataset's "Samples" tab.

From the Samples tab you can visualize, tag, filter, and explore your dataset
just as you would via the :ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>`.
