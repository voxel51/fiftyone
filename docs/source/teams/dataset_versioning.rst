Dataset Versioning
==================

.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne Teams provides native support for versioning your datasets!

Dataset Versioning allows you to capture the state of your dataset in time so
that it can be referenced in the future. This enables workflows like recalling
particular important events in the dataset's lifecycle (model trained,
annotation added, etc) as well as helping to prevent accidental data loss.

.. _dataset-versioning-overview:

Overview
________

Dataset Versioning in FiftyOne Teams is implemented as a linear sequence of
read-only :ref:`Snapshots <dataset-versioning-snapshots>`. In other words,
creating a new Snapshot creates a permanent record of the dataset’s contents
that can be loaded and viewed at any time in the future, but not directly
edited. Conversely, the current version of a dataset is called its HEAD
(think git). If you have not explicitly loaded a Snapshot, you are viewing its
HEAD, and you can make additions, updates, and deletions to the dataset’s
contents as you normally would (provided you have sufficient permissions).

Snapshots record all aspects of your data stored within FiftyOne, including
dataset-level information, schema, samples, frames, brain runs, and
evaluations. However, Snapshots exclude any information stored in external
services, such as media stored in cloud buckets or embeddings stored in an
external vector database, which are assumed to be immutable. If you need to
update the image for a sample in a dataset, for example, update the sample’s
filepath—-which is tracked by snapshots—-rather than updating the media in
cloud storage in-place—-which would not be tracked by snapshots. This design
allows dataset snapshots to be as lightweight and versatile as possible.

    |                        | :ref:`vector database <qdrant-integration>` |
    +------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

Dataset Versioning has been built with an extensible architecture so that
different versioning backends can be swapped in. Each backend may have
different tradeoffs in terms of performance, storage, and deployment needs, so
users should be able to choose the best fit for their needs. In addition, many
users may already have a versioning solution external to FiftyOne Teams, and
the goal is to support integration around those use cases as well.

Currently, only the
:ref:`internal duplication backend <internal-duplication-backend>` is
available, but further improvements and implementing additional backend choices
are :ref:`on the roadmap <dataset-versioning-roadmap>`.

.. warning::

    Dataset Versioning is not a replacement for database backups. We strongly
    encourage the use of regular data backups and good storage maintenance
    processes.

.. _dataset-versioning-snapshots:

Snapshots
_________

Dataset Versioning in FiftyOne Teams is implemented as a linear history of
**Snapshots**. A Snapshot captures the state of a dataset at a particular point
in time as an immutable object. Compare this concept to creating commits and
tags in a single branch of a version control system such as git or svn; a
Snapshot is a commit and tag (including readable name, description, creator)
all in one.

The current working version of the dataset (called the **HEAD**) can be edited
by anyone with appropriate permissions, as normal. Since Snapshots include a
commit-like operation, they can only be created on the dataset HEAD.

Snapshot states
---------------

Snapshots can be in a few different states of existence depending on deployment
choices and user actions.

.. glossary::

    Materialized Snapshot
        A Snapshot whose state and contents are entirely *materialized* in
        the MongoDB database. The Snapshot is "ready to go" and be loaded
        instantly for analysis and visualization.

    Offloaded Snapshot
        A materialized Snapshot that has been offloaded to cold storage to
        free up working space in the MongoDB instance. The Snapshot cannot be
        loaded by users until it is re-materialized into MongoDB. Since it is
        stored in its materialized form already though, an offloaded Snapshot
        can be re-materialized easily, at merely the cost of network transfer
        and MongoDB write latencies.

    Virtual Snapshot
        A Snapshot whose state and contents are stored by the pluggable backend
        versioning implementation in whatever way it chooses. In order to be
        loaded by FiftyOne Teams users, the Snapshot must be *materialized*
        into its workable form in MongoDB. This is done through a combination
        of the overarching versioning infrastructure and the specific
        versioning backend.

For a given Snapshot, the virtual form always exists. It may also be
materialized, offloaded, or both (in the case that an offloaded Snapshot has
been re-materialized but kept in cold storage also).

.. note::

    With the :ref:`internal duplication backend <internal-duplication-backend>`
    there is no distinction between materialized and virtual Snapshots since by
    definition the implementation uses materialized Snapshots as its method of
    storage.

.. _dataset-versioning-snapshot-permissions:

Snapshot permissions
____________________

The table below shows the :ref:`dataset permissions <teams-permissions>`
required to perform different Snapshot-related operations:

+----------------------------+----------------------------------+

+----------------------------+----------+----------+------------+

.. _dataset-versioning-using-snapshots:

Using snapshots
_______________

In contrast to a dataset's HEAD, Snapshots are **read-only**. When viewing in
the App, the UI is similar to interacting with a HEAD dataset, but users will
not be able to make any edits to the objects. Similarly, when using the
FiftyOne SDK, users will not be able to perform any operation that would
trigger a modification to the stored dataset.

.. _dataset-versioning-list-snapshots:

List snapshots
--------------

Teams UI
~~~~~~~~

To access the Snapshot history and management page, click the "History tab" on
a dataset's main page.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/history-tab-button.png
    :alt: history-tab-button
    :align: center

On this page you can see a listing of the Snapshot history for the dataset.
Each row contains information about a single Snapshot.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/snapshot-list.png
    :alt: snapshot-list
    :align: center

SDK
~~~

You can also list Snapshot names for a dataset using the
:meth:`list_snapshots() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.list_snapshots>` method
from the Management SDK.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    dataset_name = "quickstart"
    fom.list_snapshots(dataset_name)

Then you can get more detailed information on a single Snapshot using the
:meth:`get_snapshot_info() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.get_snapshot_info>`
method.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    dataset = "quickstart"
    snapshot_name = "v0.1"

    fom.get_snapshot_info(dataset, snapshot_name)

.. _dataset-versioning-loading-snapshots:

Loading snapshots
-----------------

Any user with Can View permissions to a dataset can view and load its snapshots
via the Teams UI or the SDK.

Teams UI
~~~~~~~~

From the dataset's History tab, click the "Browse" button next to a Snapshot in
the :ref:`snapshot list <dataset-versioning-list-snapshots>` to load the
Snapshot in the UI.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/browse-button.png
    :alt: history-browse-button
    :align: center

This will open the Snapshot in the normal dataset samples UI with all your
favorite FiftyOne visualization tools at your fingertips! However, all
dataset-modification features such as tagging have been removed.

We can also link directly to this Snapshot page by copying the URL from the
address bar or from the "Share Dataset" page which opens from the "Share"
button. For the above Snapshot, it would look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    https://<your-teams-url>/datasets/roadscene-vehicle-detection/samples?snapshot=new+snapshot

One other difference from the normal page is the Snapshot banner which gives
information about the Snapshot being viewed, and other quick-click operations.
Clicking the name line drops down a list of the Snapshots where the current one
is highlighted. Clicking on a Snapshot in the dropdown will navigate to the
browse page for that Snapshot.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/browse-banner-dropdown.png
    :alt: browse-banner-dropdown
    :align: center

On the right side of the banner, clicking the "Back to the latest version"
button will take you back to the samples page for the dataset HEAD. You can
also do this by clicking the "Samples" tab. There is also a convenient dropdown
from the 3-dot (kebab) menu which gives various
:ref:`management functions <dataset-versioning-snapshot-management>` for the
current Snapshot.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/browse-banner-right.png
    :alt: browse-banner-rightside
    :align: center

SDK
~~~

Snapshots can also be loaded via the FiftyOne SDK
:func:`load_dataset() <fiftyone.core.dataset.load_dataset>` method. The
following snippet will load an existing Snapshot of a dataset. It can then be
interacted with as if it is a normal dataset, except for any operations that
would cause modifications.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset_name = "quickstart"
    existing_snapshot_name = "v1"

    snapshot = fo.load_dataset(dataset_name, snapshot=existing_snapshot_name)
    print(snapshot)

.. _dataset-versioning-snapshot-management:

Snapshot management
___________________

The following sections describe how to create and use snapshots.

.. _dataset-versioning-creating-snapshot:

Creating a snapshot
-------------------

Users with Can Manage permissions to a dataset can create Snapshots through the
Teams UI or the Management SDK.

.. note::

    Snapshots can only be created from the HEAD of the dataset.

Teams UI
~~~~~~~~

At the top of the History tab for a dataset is the Create snapshot panel.
This panel shows the number of changes that have happened between the last
Snapshot and the current state of the dataset.

.. note::

    The latest changes summary is not continuously updated; click the "Refresh"
    button to recompute these values.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/create-refresh-button.png
    :alt: create-refresh-button
    :align: center

To create a Snapshot, provide a unique name and an optional description, then
click the "Save new snapshot" button.

.. note::

    Depending on the :ref:`versioning backend <dataset-versioning-backends>`
    used, deployment options chosen, and the size of the dataset, this may take
    some time.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/create-save-button.png
    :alt: create-save-button
    :align: center

After creation, the new Snapshot will show up in the list!

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/history-new-snapshot.png
    :alt: history-new-snapshot
    :align: center

SDK
~~~

You can also create Snapshots via the Management SDK.

To get the latest changes summary as in the Create snapshot panel, use
:meth:`get_dataset_latest_changes_summary() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.get_dataset_latest_changes_summary>`.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    fom.get_dataset_latest_changes_summary(dataset.name)

To recalculate the latest changes summary as in the Refresh button in that
panel, use
:meth:`calculate_dataset_latest_changes_summary() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.calculate_dataset_latest_changes_summary>`.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    old = fom.calculate_dataset_latest_changes_summary(dataset.name)
    assert old == fom.get_dataset_latest_changes_summary(dataset.name)

    dataset.delete_samples(dataset.take(5))

    # Cached summary hasn't been updated
    assert old == fom.get_dataset_latest_changes_summary(dataset.name)

    new = fom.calculate_dataset_latest_changes_summary(dataset.name)
    assert new.updated_at > changes.updated_at

To create a new Snapshot, use the
:meth:`create_snapshot() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.create_snapshot>`
method.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    dataset_name = "quickstart"
    snapshot_name = "v0.1"
    description = "Version 0.1 in which I have made many awesome changes!"
    snapshot = fom.create_snapshot(dataset_name, snapshot_name, description)

.. _dataset-versioning-delete-snapshot:

Deleting a snapshot
-------------------

Users with Can Manage permissions to a dataset can delete snapshots through the
Teams UI or the Management SDK.

If the Snapshot is the most recent, the latest (HEAD) sample changes summary is
not automatically recalculated. See
:ref:`this section <dataset-versioning-creating-snapshot>` to see how to
recalculate these now-stale values.

If the Snapshot is *not* the most recent, the sample change summary for the
following Snapshot will be automatically recalculated based on the previous
Snapshot.

.. warning::

    Deleting a Snapshot cannot be undone!

Teams UI
~~~~~~~~

To delete a Snapshot via the App, open the 3-dot (kebab) menu for the Snapshot.
In the menu, click "Delete snapshot". This will bring up a confirmation dialog
to prevent accidental deletions.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/delete-snapshot.png
    :alt: delete-snapshot
    :align: center

SDK
~~~

You can also use the
:meth:`delete_snapshot() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.delete_snapshot>` method
in the Management SDK.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    dataset = "quickstart"
    snapshot_name = "v0.1"
    fom.delete_snapshot(dataset, snapshot_name)

.. _dataset-versioning-rollback-to-snapshot:

Rollback dataset to snapshot
----------------------------

In case unwanted edits have been added to the dataset HEAD, FiftyOne provides
the ability for dataset Managers to roll the dataset back (revert) to the state
of a given Snapshot.

.. warning::

    This is a destructive operation! Rolling back to a Snapshot discards
    **all** changes between the selected Snapshot and the current working
    version of the dataset, including all newer Snapshots.

Teams UI
~~~~~~~~

To revert a dataset to a Snapshot's state, click the 3-dot (kebab) menu in
the History tab for the Snapshot you want to rollback to and select
"Rollback to this snapshot". This will bring up a confirmation dialog to
prevent accidental deletions.

.. image:: /images/teams/versioning/rollback-snapshot.png
    :alt: rollback-snapshot
    :align: center

SDK
~~~

You can also use the
:meth:`revert_dataset_to_snapshot() <fiftyone.management.snapshot.revert_dataset_to_snapshot>`
method in the Management SDK.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    dataset = "quickstart"
    snapshot_name = "v0.1"
    description = "Initial dataset snapshot"
    fom.create_snapshot(dataset, snapshot_name, description)

    # Oops we deleted everything!
    dataset.delete_samples(dataset.values("id"))

    # Phew!
    fom.revert_dataset_to_snapshot(dataset.name, snapshot_name)
    dataset.reload()

    assert len(dataset) > 0

.. _dataset-versioning-backends:

Pluggable backends
__________________

Dataset versioning was built with an extensible architecture to support
different versioning backend implementations being built and swapped in to
better suit the users' needs and technology preferences. In the future, this
section will contain information and discussion about each of these available
backends, including their strengths/limitations and configuration options.

For the initial release in FiftyOne Teams v1.4.0, however, there is only one
backend choice described below. Additional backends may be implemented in the
future, but for now, releasing dataset versioning with the first
iteration was prioritized so that users can begin to see value and provide
feedback as soon as possible.

.. _internal-duplication-backend:

Internal duplication backend
----------------------------

This backend is similar to cloning a dataset; Snapshots are stored in the same
MongoDB database as the original dataset.

Creating a Snapshot with this backend is similar to cloning a dataset in terms
of performance and storage needs.

Creating a Snapshot should take roughly the same amount of time as cloning the
dataset, and so is proportional to the size of the dataset being versioned.

At this time, Snapshots are stored in the same database as the original dataset.
In the future, support will be implemented for offloading Snapshots to a separate
data store, such as cloud storage, to reduce the load on the FiftyOne database.

These requirements should be taken into consideration when using Snapshots and
when determining values for the
:ref:`max number of Snapshots allowed <dataset-versioning-configuration>`.

Time and space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Time**

The create Snapshot operation takes time proportional to cloning the dataset.
This backend is the most performant when creating a Snapshot then immediately
loading it for use; while other backends would have to store the virtual
Snapshot and then materialize it, this one simply does one big intra-MongoDB
clone.

Additionally, change summary calculation can be slow.

.. note::

    In v1.4.0, calculating number of samples modified in particular can
    cause slowdown with larger datasets. This value is not computed for
    datasets larger than 200 thousand samples.

**Space**

The amount of storage required scales with the number of Snapshots created, not
the volume of changes. Since it is stored in the same database as normal
datasets, creating too many Snapshots without the ability to offload them
could fill up the database.

Strengths
~~~~~~~~~

+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ✅ | Simple                                                                 |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ✅ | Uses existing MongoDB; no extra deployment components                  |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ✅ | Browsing/loading is fast because the Snapshots are always materialized |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ✅ | For a create-then-load workflow, it has the lowest overhead cost of    |
|    | any backend since materialized and virtual forms are one and the same  |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ❌ | Creating a Snapshot takes time proportional to clone dataset           |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ❌ | Calculating sample change summaries is less efficient                  |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ❌ | Storage is highly duplicative                                          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no unique configuration options for this backend.

.. _dataset-versioning-usage-considerations:

Usage considerations
____________________

Best practices
--------------

As this feature matures, we will have better recommendations for best practices.
For now given the limited starting options in the intial iteration, we have the
following advice:

-   Use snapshots on smaller datasets if possible.
-   Since space is at a premium, limit creation of snapshots to marking milestone
    events which you want to revisit or restore later.
-   Delete old snapshots you don't need anymore.
-   Set the :ref:`versioning configuration <dataset-versioning-configuration>`
    to the highest your deployment can comfortably support, to better enable
    user workflows with breaking the (MongoDB) bank.

.. _dataset-versioning-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Since Snapshots impact the storage needs of FiftyOne Teams, some guard rails
have been put in place to control the maximum amount of Snapshots that can be
created. If a threshold has been exceeded while a user attempts to create a
new Snapshot, they will receive an error informing them that it may be time to
remove old Snapshots.

The configurations allowed are described in the table below. Adjusting these
defaults should be done in consideration with the needs of the team and the
storage requirements necessary.

+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Config name                   | Environment variable                   | Default | Description                                                               |
+===============================+========================================+=========+===========================================================================+
| Maximum total Snapshots       | ``FIFTYONE_SNAPSHOTS_MAX_IN_DB``       | 100     | The max total number of Snapshots allowed at once. -1 for no limit.       |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Maximum Snapshots per-dataset | ``FIFTYONE_SNAPSHOTS_MAX_PER_DATASET`` | 20      | The max number of Snapshots allowed per dataset. -1 for no limit.         |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
