`FiftyOne Teams <https://voxel51.com/fiftyone-teams/>`_ enables multiple users
to securely collaborate on the same datasets and models, either on-premises or
in the cloud, all built on top of the open source FiftyOne workflows that
you're already relying on.

FiftyOne Teams is fully backwards-compatible with the
`open source project <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone>`_, so all other
pages on this site apply to Teams deployments as well.
