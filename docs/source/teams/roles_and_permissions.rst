Roles and permissions
=====================

.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne Teams is built for collaboration, with the goal of making it as easy
as possible for engineers, data scientists, and stakeholders to work together
to build high quality datasets and computer vision models.

Accordingly, FiftyOne Teams gives you the flexibility to configure user roles,
user groups and fine-grained permissions so that you can safely and securely
collaborate both inside and outside your organization at all stages of your
workflows.

This page introduces the basic roles and permissions available in
FiftyOne Teams.

.. _teams-roles:

Roles
_____

FiftyOne Teams has four user roles: Admin, Member, Collaborator, and Guest.

Admins can access user management features by clicking on their account icon in
the upper-right of the FiftyOne Teams App and navigating to the
"Settings > Team > Users" page:

   :align: center

Admins can invite new users by clicking on "Invite people", as shown below.
Invited users will receive an email invitation with a link to accept the
invitation.

.. note::

   Invited users may login using any identity provider that has been enabled
   on your deployment. Contact your Voxel51 CS engineer for more information
   about configuring IdPs.

.. _teams-admin:

Admin
-----

Admins have full access to all of an organization's datasets and can
create, edit, and delete any dataset.

Admins can also invite or remove users from the organization and change any
other user's roles, including promoting/demoting users to admins.

.. _teams-member:

Member
------

Members can create new datasets and can be granted any desired level of
permission on existing datasets. Members may also have a
:ref:`default access level <teams-default-access>` to datasets that use this
feature.

Members do not have the ability to see or manage an organization's users.

.. _teams-collaborator:

Collaborator
------------

Collaborators only have access to datasets to which they have been specifically
granted access (a dataset's
:ref:`default access level <teams-default-access>` does not apply to
Collaborators), and they may only be granted **Can view** or **Can edit**
access to datasets.

Collaborators cannot create new datasets, clone existing datasets, or view
other users of the deployment. Collaborators may export datasets to which
they've been granted access.

.. _teams-guest:

Guest
-----

Guests only have access to datasets to which they have been specifically
granted access (a dataset's
:ref:`default access level <teams-default-access>` does not apply to Guests),
and they may only be granted **Can view** access to datasets.

Guests cannot create new datasets, clone existing datasets, export datasets, or
view other users of the deployment.

.. _teams-groups:

Groups
------

User groups in FiftyOne Teams allow organization admins to manage a collection
of users as a single entity. This simplifies the process of assigning
permissions to multiple users, making it more efficient to control access to
datasets.

Admins can manage groups through the "Settings > Team > Groups" page.
Each group can be given specific dataset access permissions, which apply to
all users within the group. Collaborators' and guests' access to the dataset is 
limited by the maximum dataset access level of the role. 

.. image:: /images/teams/admin_team_groups_page.png
   :alt: admin-team-groups-page
   :align: center

Admins can create a new group by clicking on "Create group" and then adding
existing users to the group by clicking on "Add users".

   :align: center

.. note::

   Non-existing users cannot be directly added to a group. Users must be
   invited and accept the invitation before they can be added to a group.

.. _teams-permissions:

Permissions
___________

Admins and users with the **Can manage** permission on a dataset can configure
a dataset's permissions under the dataset's
:ref:`Manage tab <teams-managing-datasets>` in the FiftyOne Teams App.

In FiftyOne Teams, dataset permissions for a user are determined by both the
access they receive from their groups' permissions and individual permissions
assigned to them.

A userâ€™s permissions on a dataset is the maximum of their permissions from the
following sources:

-  Admins implicitly have full access to all datasets
-  Members have the dataset's
   :ref:`default access level <teams-default-access>`
-  Users may be granted :ref:`specific access <teams-specific-access>` to the
   dataset
-  Users may be members of one or more groups, each of which may have
   :ref:`specific access <teams-specific-access>` to the dataset

.. note::

   User role determines the highest level of access that a user can be granted
   to a dataset. For example, a user with Guest role can be added to a group
   with **Can edit** permission to a dataset, but this user will have
   **Can view** permission instead of **Can edit** permission of the dataset,
   because Guest role only allows **Can view** permission to datasets.

.. _teams-default-access:

Default access
--------------

All datasets have a default access level, which defines a minimum permission
level that all Members have on the dataset.

A dataset's default access level can be set to **No access**, **Can view**,
**Can edit**, or **Can manage** as shown below:

.. image:: /images/teams/dataset_default_access.png
   :alt: default-access
   :align: center

.. note::

   Default access level only applies to Members. Guests and Collaborators must
   be granted :ref:`specific access <teams-specific-access>` to datasets.

.. _teams-specific-access:

People and groups with access
-----------------------------

Authorized users can grant specific access to a dataset using the "People and
groups with access" section shown below.

To give access to an existing user or group, simply click "Share" button on
the top right. A list of users with access to the dataset is shown. Click
"Add User" or "Add Group" to grant access to a new user or group.

   :alt: specific-access
   :align: center

.. image:: /images/teams/dataset_specific_access.png
   :alt: specific-access
   :align: center

The following permissions are available to each user role:

-  Groups may be granted **Can view**, **Can edit**, or **Can manage**
   permissions
-  Members may be granted **Can view**, **Can edit**, or **Can manage**
   permissions
-  Collaborators may be granted **Can view** or **Can edit** permissions
-  Guests may be granted **Can view** permissions

.. note::

   Authorized users can use the "Grant access" workflow to give **Can view**
   or **Can edit** access to a dataset to an email address that is not yet a
   user of a FiftyOne Teams deployment.

   When the invitation is accepted, the user will become a Guest or
   Collaborator (depending on whether **Can view** or **Can edit** access was
   granted, respectively), and an Admin can upgrade this user to another role
   if desired via the Team Settings page.

.. _teams-no-access:

No access
---------

If a user has no access to a dataset, the dataset will not appear in the user's
search results or show on their dataset listing page. Any direct links to this
dataset that the user attempts to open will show a 404 page.

.. _teams-can-view:

Can view
--------

A user with **Can view** permissions on a dataset can find the dataset from
their dataset listing page.

Users with **Can view** permissions cannot modify the dataset in any way, for
example by adding or removing samples, tags, annotation runs, brain runs, etc.

.. note::

   Members (but not Guests or Collaborators) with **Can view** access to a
   dataset may clone the dataset.

.. _teams-can-edit:

Can edit
--------

A user with **Can edit** permissions on a dataset has all permissions from
**Can view** and, in addition, can modify the dataset, including:

-  Adding, editing, and deleting samples
-  Adding, editing, and deleting tags
-  Adding and deleting annotation runs, brain runs, etc.

.. note::

   Deleting a dataset requires the **Can manage** permission.

.. _teams-can-manage:

Can manage
----------

A user with **Can manage** permissions on a dataset has all permissions from
**Can view** and **Can edit** and, in addition, can delete the dataset and
configure the permissions on the dataset of other users.

Remember that all admins can implicitly access and manage all datasets created
on your team's deployment.

.. note::

   Any member who creates a dataset (including cloning an existing dataset or
   view) will be granted **Can manage** permissions on the new dataset.
