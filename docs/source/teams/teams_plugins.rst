FiftyOne Teams Plugins
======================

.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne Teams provides native support for installing and running
:ref:`FiftyOne plugins <fiftyone-plugins>`, which offers powerful opportunities
to extend and customize the functionality of your Teams deployment to suit your
needs.

.. note::

    What can you do with plugins? Check out
    :ref:`delegated operations <teams-delegated-operations>` to see some quick
    examples, then check out the
    `FiftyOne plugins <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins>`_
    repository for a growing collection of prebuilt plugins that you can add to
    your Teams deployment!

.. _teams-plugins-page:

Plugins page
____________

Admins can use the plugins page to upload, manage, and configure permissions
for plugins that are made available to users of your Teams deployment.

Admins can access the plugins page under Settings > Plugins. It displays a
list of all installed plugins and their operators, as well as the enablement
and permissions of each.

        default_operator_minimum_role=fom.MEMBER,
        default_operator_minimum_dataset_permission=fom.EDIT,
    )

.. _teams-delegated-operations:

Delegated operations
____________________

:ref:`Delegated operations <delegated-operations>` are a powerful feature of
FiftyOne's plugin framework that allows users to schedule tasks from within the
App that are executed on a connected workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow.

With FiftyOne Teams, your team can
:ref:`upload and permission <teams-plugins-page>` custom operations that your
users can execute from the Teams App, all of which run against a central
orchestrator :ref:`configured by <teams-delegated-orchestrator>` your admins.

Why is this awesome? Your AI stack needs a flexible data-centric component that
enables you to organize and compute on your data. With delegated operations,
FiftyOne Teams becomes both a dataset management/visualization tool and a
workflow automation tool that defines how your data-centric workflows like
ingestion, curation, and evaluation are performed. In short, think of FiftyOne
Teams as the single source of truth on which you co-develop your data and
models together.

What can delegated operations do for you? Get started by installing any of
these plugins available in the
`FiftyOne Plugins <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins>`_ repository:

For example, wish you could import data from within the App? With the
`@voxel51/io <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/io/README.md>`_,
plugin you can!

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/import.gif

Want to send data for annotation from within the App? Sure thing, just install the
`@voxel51/annotation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/annotation/README.md>`_
plugin:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/annotation.gif

Have model predictions on your dataset that you want to evaluate? The
`@voxel51/evaluation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/evaluation/README.md>`_
plugin makes it easy:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/evaluation.gif

Need to compute embedding for your dataset so you can visualize them in the
:ref:`Embeddings panel <app-embeddings-panel>`? Kick off the task with the
`@voxel51/brain <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/brain/README.md>`_
plugin and proceed with other work while the execution happens in the background:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/embeddings.gif

When you choose delegated execution in the App, these tasks are automatically
scheduled for execution on your
:ref:`connected orchestrator <teams-delegated-orchestrator>` and you can
continue with other work. Meanwhile, all datasets have a
:ref:`Runs tab <teams-managing-delegated-operations>` in the App where you can
browse a history of all delegated operations that have been run on the dataset
and their status.

.. _teams-delegated-orchestrator:

Setting up an orchestrator
__________________________

All delegated operations that have been scheduled by users of a FiftyOne Teams
deployment will remain queued until a connected orchestrator picks them up and
executes them.

.. note::

    This section describes how to configure an
    `Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org>`_ orchestrator in a
    development environment.

    Want to run delegated operations at scale? Contact your Voxel51 support
    team to discuss adding a production-grade cluster to your FiftyOne Teams
    deployment.

To set up Airflow as an orchestrator to run delegated operations, you will need
to:

-   Provision a VM or instance with enough resources to run the operations you
    want to delegate
-   Install
    `Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/index.html>`_
    on the VM
-   Install the appropriate version of the FiftyOne Teams SDK for the Teams
    deployment that you are connecting to
-   Ensure that your :ref:`team's plugins <teams-plugins-page>` are available
    to the Orchestrator, either by installing them on the same machine or by
    making them available via a shared filesystem
-   Ensure that the required environment variables are set (see below)
-   Install a
    `FiftyOne Airflow DAG <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/orchestrators/airflow>`_
-   You're all set. Schedule those operations!

There are some required configurations. For information on other optional
configurations, see :ref:`Configuring FiftyOne <configuring-fiftyone>`.

.. note::

    Refer to :ref:`this section <teams-media-cache-config>` for more
    information on media caching and access in FiftyOne Teams. Make sure that
    cloud storage permissions are configured if some operators will access
    media.

.. note::

    The Orchestrator will need to have all of the required dependencies
    installed for running your Team's operations. For example, if running the
    `@voxel51/brain/compute_visualization <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/brain>`_
    operator, the orchestrator will need the `torch` and `torchvision` packages
    installed.

Example: Google Compute Engine
------------------------------

This section configures Airflow on a Google Compute Engine instance.

**Provision VM**

First, provision a VM with the resources required to run the operations you
want to delegate. Take note of the IP of the VM, you'll need it in a later
step.

SSH into the instance, ensure the packages are up to date, and install python:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install python3-pip

**Install Airflow**

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install apache-airflow[gcp]

ensure a successful install by checking the version:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow version

Initialize the airflow db and create a user:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow db init
    airflow users create -r Admin -u <username> -p <password> -e <email> -f <first name> -l <last name>

.. note::

    This username and password will be the account you use to log into the
    airflow interface in a later step.

**Launch Aiflow**

Open 2 more ssh sessions, and start the webserver and scheduler in each.

.. note::

    You could run these commands with the `-D` flag to run them in the
    background, but we recommend running them in the foreground for debugging
    purposes.

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow webserver -p 8080
    airflow scheduler

.. note::

    You could start airflow on the port of your choice, but ensure that the
    firewall rules allow traffic on that port.

**Add the Firewall Rule**

Navigate to the networking/firewall rules section of the google cloud console
and allow traffic on that port for the VM.

Once this is done, you should be able to navigate to the airflow interface at
`http://<vm ip>:8080` (or the port you chose) and log in with the credentials
you created earlier.

**Mount the Plugins Directory**

The orchestrator must have the same plugins available to it as the instance
which queued the operation. This could be accomplished by either installing the
plugins on the orchestrator, or by mounting the plugins directory from the
instance which queued the operation.

To mount the plugins directory, locate the ip of the nfs server then run the
following commands on the orchestrator:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/shared
    sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=4,rw,intr <ip of the nfs server>:/path/to/plugins /mnt/nfs/shared

You might also want to add the same command to your startup tasks, located in
``etc/fstab``:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pico /etc/fstab

paste the following and save:

.. code-block:: bash

    $NFS_SERVER_ID:/path/to/fiftyone-plugins /mnt/nfs/shared/ nfs vers=4,rw,intr 0 0

the path to the plugins should now be available at `/mnt/nfs/shared/plugins`.
To test this, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ls /mnt/nfs/shared/plugins

This path will be added to the environment variables as
``FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR`` in a following step.

**Install FiftyOne**

Ensure the keyring is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth

and then install FiftyOne:

.. code-block:: bash

    INDEX_URL="https://us-central1-python.pkg.dev/computer-vision-team/dev-python/simple/"
    pip --no-cache-dir install --extra-index-url $INDEX_URL fiftyone

**Configure environment variables**

Now we need to configure the necessary environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

    pico ~/.profile

Add the following lines to the bottom of the file, replacing the values with
the appropriate values for your deployment.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Configure where plugins source lives
    export FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR=...  # eg /mnt/nfs/shared/plugins

    #
    # Copy the values below from your Teams deployment
    #

    # Provide your encryption key so the orchestrator can access secrets
    export FIFTYONE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...
    export FIFTYONE_INTERNAL_SERVICE=1

    # Direct mongo connection for database operations
    export FIFTYONE_DATABASE_NAME=...
    export FIFTYONE_DATABASE_URI=...

    # Admin API connection for resolving secrets and permissions
    export FIFTYONE_API_KEY=...
    export API_URL=...

**Add Airflow DAG**

Check the default DAGs path by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow config list | grep dags_folder

.. note::

    The default DAG folder path is `/home/<user>/airflow/dags`.

Navigate to the DAG folder and add a
`FiftyOne Airflow DAG <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/orchestrators/airflow>`_.

Open the Airflow interface and ensure that the DAG is visible. Any issues
should be immediately visible as errors. Locate the dag and toggle it on, then
refresh to make sure it's running. If no operations have been queued, it will
still run a check and all runs should be green.

.. note::

    The Orchestrator will need to have all of the required dependencies
    installed for running your Team's operations. For example, if running the
    `@voxel51/brain/compute_visualization <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/brain>`_
    operator, the orchestrator will need the `torch` and `torchvision` packages
    installed.

.. _teams-managing-delegated-operations:

Managing delegated operations
_____________________________

Every Teams dataset has a Runs page that allows users to monitor and explore
delegated operations scheduled against that dataset.

.. note::

    The Runs page only tracks operations that are *delegated* to your Team's
    orchestrator, not operations that are executed immediately in the App.

.. _teams-runs-page:

Runs page
---------

The Runs page is accessible to all users with Can view access to the dataset.

You can access the Runs page by clicking on the "Runs" tab from the
:ref:`Samples tab <teams-using-datasets>`.

Once you are on the Runs page, you will see a table with the list of all
operators scheduled by any user of your organization on the dataset. You can
sort, search and filter runs listed to refine the list as you like:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_page.png

.. _teams-runs-sorting:

Sorting
^^^^^^^

By default, the runs table is sorted by recency, but you can use the dropdown
menu in the upper left of table to sort by other fields like update time or the
name of the operator:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/sort.png

.. _teams-runs-filtering:

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^

You can also filter the runs table to see a subset of runs.

Use the "My runs" radio button to see only the runs that you scheduled:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/my_runs.png

You can further refine the list of runs using the status dropdown to select one
or more status you would like to filter by:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/filter_by_status.png

.. _teams-runs-searching:

Searching
^^^^^^^^^

You can also use the search functionality to filter the list of runs by
keyword. As you type your query in the search box, the list of runs will be
updated to show only the runs matching your query:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/search_by_name.png

.. note::

    Search is case-sensitive and you can currently only search by operator
    name, not label. For example, searches will not match against
    **Demo: Export to GCP** in the image above.

.. _teams-runs-re-running:

Re-running
^^^^^^^^^^

From the Runs page, you can trigger a re-run of any listed run by clicking the
three-dots to open actions menu and then clicking "Re-run":

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/re_run.png

.. _teams-runs-pinning:

Pinning
^^^^^^^

Pinned runs are displayed to the right of the runs table. By default, five
pinned runs will be displayed. However, if there are more than five pinned
runs, you will see a button to expand the list.

To pin a run, hover over its row in the runs table and click the pin icon that
appears beside the operator label:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/pinning.png

.. note::

    Pinned runs are stored at the dataset-level and will be visible to all
    users with access to the dataset.

.. _teams-runs-renaming:

Renaming
^^^^^^^^

When delegating an operator multiple times on the same dataset, you may wish to
give the runs custom labels so that you can easily identify each run later.

To edit the label of an operator run, move your mouse cursor over the label of
interest and click the pencil button as indicated by "1" below. This will
present an input field indicated by "2" where you can update label to text of
your choice. Once you are ready to apply changes, click the save button
indicated by "3".

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/edit_label.png

.. _teams-runs-mark-as-failed:

Mark as failed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a delegated operation run terminates unexpectedly without reporting failure,
you can manually mark it as failed from the Runs page.

To mark a run as failed, click the three dots indicated by "1". Then, in the
menu, click "Mark as failed" as indicated by "2". The run status will be
updated and will now display as failed.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/mark_as_failed.png

.. note::

    If the delegated operation is, in fact, still in progress in your
    orchestrator, marking the run as failed will **not** terminate the
    execution of operation.

.. _teams-runs-monitoring-progress:

Monitoring progress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delegated operations can optionally
:ref:`report their progress <operator-reporting-progress>` during execution.

If a progress is available for a run, it will be displayed in the Runs table
as indicated by "2". By default, the progress of running operations is
automatically refreshed. You can disable auto-refresh of running operations by
toggling the auto refresh setting indicated by "1".

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_progress.png

.. note::

    Only the progress of running operations is automatically refreshed.

.. _teams-run-page:

Run page
--------

The Run page allows you to see information about a specific run such as inputs,
outputs, and errors.

You can visit the Run page for a run by clicking on a run in the runs table,
the Pinned runs, or Recent runs widgets.

Input
^^^^^

The Input tab on the Run page lets you see the input parameters that were
provided when the run was scheduled:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/input.png

**Raw input**

By default, a rendered version (similar to what is displayed when invoking an
operator) of input parameters is displayed. However, you can switch to raw view
by clicking the "Show raw" toggle button:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/raw_input.png

Output
^^^^^^

The Output tab on the Run page lets you see the preview of the result of a
completed run:

.. note::

    Output tab is only available for completed run.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/output.png

Errors
^^^^^^

The Errors tab on the Run page will appear if the run failed and lets you see
the errors that occurred:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/errors.png

View
^^^^

The View tab on the Run page lets you see the dataset view on which the run was
scheduled:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/view.png
