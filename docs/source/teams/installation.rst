FiftyOne Teams Installation
===========================

.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne Teams deployments come with a centralized FiftyOne Teams App and
database that allows your entire team to collaborate securely on the same
datasets. FiftyOne Teams is deployed entirely into your environment, either
on-premises or in a private cloud. Your data never leaves your environment.

FiftyOne Teams can be deployed on a wide variety of infrastructure solutions,
including Kubernetes and Docker.

.. note::

    Detailed instructions for the initial FiftyOne Teams deployment, along with
    all necessary components, are made available by your Voxel51 CS engineer
    during the onboarding process.

.. _teams-python-sdk:

Python SDK
----------

While the :ref:`FiftyOne Teams App <teams-app>` allows for countless new
App-centric workflows, any existing Python-based workflows that you've fallen
in love with in the open-source version of FiftyOne are still directly
applicable!

FiftyOne Teams requires an updated Python SDK, which is a wrapper around the
open-source FiftyOne package that adds new functionality like support for
cloud-backed media.

You can find the installation instructions under the "Install FiftyOne" section
of the Teams App by clicking on your user icon in the upper right corner:

.. image:: /images/teams/install_fiftyone.png
   :alt: install-teams
   :align: center
   :width: 300

There you'll see instructions for installing a `fiftyone` package from the
private PyPI server as shown below:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install --index-url https://{$TOKEN}@pypi.fiftyone.ai fiftyone

.. note::

   The Teams Python package is named `fiftyone` and has the same module
   structure as :doc:`fiftyone <../api/fiftyone>`, so any existing scripts you
   built using open source will continue to run after you upgrade!

**Next Steps**

After installing the Teams Python SDK in your virtual environment, you'll need
to configure two things:

*   Your team's :ref:`API connection <teams-api-connection>` or
    :ref:`MongoDB connection <configuring-mongodb-connection>`

*   The :ref:`cloud credentials <teams-cloud-credentials>` to access your
    cloud-backed media

That's it! Any operations you perform will be stored in a centralized location
and will be available to all users with access to the same datasets in the
Teams App or their Python workflows.


.. _teams-cloud-credentials:

Cloud credentials
-----------------


.. _teams-cors:

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
_________

If your datasets will include cloud-backed :ref:`point-cloud files <point-cloud-datasets>`
or :ref:`segmentation maps <semantic-segmentation>`, you may also need to configure 
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for your cloud buckets. Details are provided below
for each cloud platform.


.. _teams-amazon-s3:

Amazon S3
_________

To work with FiftyOne datasets whose media are stored in Amazon S3, you simply
need to provide
`AWS credentials <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-a-configuration-file>`_
to your Teams client with read access to the relevant objects and buckets.

You can do this in any of the following ways:

1. Configure/provide AWS credentials in accordance with the
`boto3 <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#configuring-credentials>`_
python library.

2. Permanently register AWS credentials on a particular machine by adding the
following keys to your :ref:`media cache config <teams-media-cache-config>`:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "aws_config_file": "/path/to/aws-config.ini",
        "aws_profile": "default"  # optional
    }

In the above, the `.ini` file should use the syntax of the
`boto3 configuration file <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-a-configuration-file>`_.

.. note::

    FiftyOne Teams requires either the `s3:ListBucket` or
    `s3:GetBucketLocation` permission in order to access objects in S3 buckets.

    If you wish to use multi-account credentials, your credentials must have
    the `s3:ListBucket` permission, as `s3:GetBucketLocation` does not support
    this.

If you need to `configure CORS on your AWS buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enabling-cors-examples.html>`_,
here is an example configuration:

.. code-block:: json

    [
        {
            "origin": ["https://fiftyone-teams-deployment.yourcompany.com"],
            "method": ["GET", "HEAD"],
            "responseHeader": ["*"],
            "maxAgeSeconds": 86400
        }
    ] 

.. _teams-google-cloud:

Google Cloud Storage
____________________

To work with FiftyOne datasets whose media are stored in Google Cloud Storage,
you simply need to provide
`service account credentials <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts>`_
to your Teams client with read access to the relevant objects and buckets.

You can register GCP credentials on a particular machine by adding the
following key to your :ref:`media cache config <teams-media-cache-config>`:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "google_application_credentials": "/path/to/gcp-service-account.json"
    }

If you need to `configure CORS on your GCP buckets <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-cors>`_,
here is an example configuration:

.. code-block:: json

    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "*"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET",
                "HEAD",
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "https://fiftyone-teams-deployment.yourcompany.com"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": [
                "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
                "x-amz-request-id",
                "x-amz-id-2"
            ],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
        }
    ]

.. _teams-azure:

Microsoft Azure
_______________

To work with FiftyOne datasets whose media are stored in Azure Storage, you
simply need to provide
`Azure credentials <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/authorize-data-operations-cli>`_
to your Teams client with read access to the relevant objects and containers.

You can do this in any of the following ways:

1. Permanently register Azure credentials on a particular machine by adding the
following keys to your :ref:`media cache config <teams-media-cache-config>`:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "azure_credentials_file": "/path/to/azure-credentials.ini",
        "azure_profile": "default"  # optional
    }

2. Provide Azure credentials on a per-session basis by setting the following
environment variables to point to your Azure credentials on disk:

.. code-block:: shell

    export AZURE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/azure-credentials.ini
    export AZURE_PROFILE=default  # optional

3. Provide your Azure credentials on a per-session basis by setting any group
of environment variables shown below:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Option 1
    export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=...
    export AZURE_ALIAS=...  # optional

.. code-block:: shell

    # Option 2
    export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=...
    export AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=...
    export AZURE_ALIAS=...  # optional

.. code-block:: shell

    # Option 3
    export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=...
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=...
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID=...
    export AZURE_ALIAS=...  # optional

4. Provide your Azure credentials in any manner recognized by
`azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python>`_

In the options above, the `.ini` file should have syntax similar to one of
the following:

.. code-block:: shell

    [default]
    conn_str = ...
    alias = ...  # optional

.. code-block:: shell

    [default]
    account_name = ...
    account_key = ...
    alias = ...  # optional

.. code-block:: shell

    [default]
    account_name = ...
    client_id = ...
    secret = ...
    tenant = ...
    alias = ...  # optional

When populating samples with Azure Storage filepaths, you can either specify
paths by their full URL:

.. code-block:: python

    filepath = "https://${account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/object.ext"

    # For example
    filepath = "https://voxel51.blob.core.windows.net/test-container/image.jpg"

or, if you have defined an alias in your config, you may instead prefix the
alias:

.. code-block:: python

    filepath = "${alias}://container/path/to/object.ext"

    # For example
    filepath = "az://test-container/image.jpg"

.. note::

    If you use a
    `custom Azure domain <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-custom-domain-name?tabs=azure-portal>`_,
    you can provide it by setting the
    `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL` environment variable or by including the
    `account_url` key in your credentials `.ini` file.

.. _teams-minio:

MinIO
_____

To work with FiftyOne datasets whose media are stored in
`MinIO <https://min.io/>`_, you simply need to provide the credentials to your
Teams client with read access to the relevant objects and buckets.

You can do this in any of the following ways:

1. Permanently register MinIO credentials on a particular machine by adding the
following keys to your :ref:`media cache config <teams-media-cache-config>`:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "minio_config_file": "/path/to/minio-config.ini",
        "minio_profile": "default"  # optional
    }

2. Provide MinIO credentials on a per-session basis by setting the following
environment variables to point to your MinIO credentials on disk:

.. code-block:: shell

    export MINIO_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/minio-config.ini
    export MINIO_PROFILE=default  # optional

3. Provide your MinIO credentials on a per-session basis by setting the
individual environment variables shown below:

.. code-block:: shell

    export MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=...
    export MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
    export MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL=...
    export MINIO_ALIAS=...  # optional
    export MINIO_REGION=...  # if applicable

In the options above, the `.ini` file should have syntax similar the following:

.. code-block:: shell

    [default]
    access_key = ...
    secret_access_key = ...
    endpoint_url = ...
    alias = ...  # optional
    region = ...  # if applicable

When populating samples with MinIO filepaths, you can either specify paths by
prefixing your MinIO endpoint URL:

.. code-block:: python

    filepath = "${endpoint_url}/bucket/path/to/object.ext"

    # For example
    filepath = "https://voxel51.min.io/test-bucket/image.jpg"

or, if you have defined an alias in your config, you may instead prefix the
alias:

.. code-block:: python

    filepath = "${alias}://bucket/path/to/object.ext"

    # For example
    filepath = "minio://test-bucket/image.jpg"
