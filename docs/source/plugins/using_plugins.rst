Using Plugins
=============

.. default-role:: code

Every plugin that you :ref:`download <plugins-download>` exposes one or more
:ref:`Panels <using-panels>` and/or :ref:`Operators <using-operators>` that you
can access from within the App.

.. note::

    Check out the
    `FiftyOne plugins <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins>`_
    repository for a growing collection of plugins that you can easily
    :ref:`download <plugins-download>` and use locally.

    Then, after you get comfortable using prebuilt plugins, try your hand at
    :ref:`writing your own <developing-plugins>`!

.. _plugins-download:

Downloading plugins
___________________

To download and use a plugin, all you need is the plugin's GitHub repository or
a link to a ZIP archive of the plugin's source code.

You can download plugins using any of the methods described below:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: CLI

    .. code-block:: shell

        # Download plugin(s) from a GitHub repository
        fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/<user>/<repo>[/tree/branch]

        # Download plugin(s) by specifying the GitHub repository details
        fiftyone plugins download <user>/<repo>[/<ref>]

        # Download specific plugins from a GitHub repository
        fiftyone plugins download \
            https://github.com/<user>/<repo>[/tree/branch] \
            --plugin-names <name1> <name2> <name3>

  .. group-tab:: Python

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        import fiftyone.plugins as fop

        # Download plugin(s) from a GitHub repository
        fop.download_plugin("https://github.com/<user>/<repo>[/tree/branch]")

        # Download plugin(b) by specifying the GitHub repository details
        fop.download_plugin("<user>/<repo>[/<ref>]")

        # Download specific plugins from a GitHub repository
        fop.download_plugin(url_or_gh_repo, plugin_names=["<name1>", "<name2>"])

.. note::

    A GitHub repository may contain multiple plugins. By default, all plugins
    that are found within the first three directory levels are installed, but
    you can select specific ones if desired as shown above.

.. note::

    All plugins are downloaded to your
    :ref:`plugins directory <plugins-directory>`.

.. note::

    You can download plugins from private GitHub repositories that you have
    access to by providing your GitHub personal access token via the
    `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

.. _plugins-directory:

Your plugins directory
______________________

All plugins must be stored (and are automatically
:ref:`downloaded to <plugins-download>` your plugins directory in order for
FiftyOne to find them.

By default, plugins are downloaded to `~/fiftyone/__plugins__`, but you can
customize this directory by setting the `FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR` environment
variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/your/plugins

You can also permanently configure this directory by adding it to your
:ref:`FiftyOne config <configuring-fiftyone>`.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "plugins_dir": "/path/to/your/plugins"
    }

You can locate your current plugins directory by running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    fiftyone config plugins_dir
    # ~/fiftyone/__plugins__

.. note::

    Your plugins directory must be readable by the FiftyOne server.

.. _plugins-managing:

Managing plugins
________________

You can use the :ref:`fiftyone plugins <cli-fiftyone-plugins>` and
:ref:`fiftyone operators <cli-fiftyone-operators>` CLI methods to perform a
variety of plugin-related actions.

    directory               ~/fiftyone/__plugins__/fiftyone-plugins/plugins/annotation

Getting operator info
---------------------

You can use the :ref:`fiftyone operators info <cli-fiftyone-operators-info>` to
view the available metadata about an individual operator within a plugin:

.. code-block:: shell

    fiftyone operators info @voxel51/io/import_samples

.. code-block:: text

    key                        value

    light_icon                 /assets/icon-light.svg

Installing plugin requirements
------------------------------

You can use the
:ref:`fiftyone plugins requirements <cli-fiftyone-plugins-requirements>`
command to view, install, and ensure installation of a plugin's requirements:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Print requirements for a plugin
    fiftyone plugins requirements <name> --print

.. code-block:: shell

    # Install any requirements for the plugin
    fiftyone plugins requirements <name> --install

.. code-block:: shell

    # Ensures that the requirements for the plugin are satisfied
    fiftyone plugins requirements <name> --ensure

Enabling and disabling plugins
------------------------------

You can use the
:ref:`fiftyone plugins enable <cli-fiftyone-plugins-enable>` and
:ref:`fiftyone plugins disable <cli-fiftyone-plugins-disable>` commands to
enable and disable plugins that you've downloaded:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Enable a plugin
    fiftyone plugins enable <name>

    # Enable multiple plugins
    fiftyone plugins enable <name1> <name2> ...

    # Enable all plugins
    fiftyone plugins enable --all

.. code-block:: shell

    # Disable a plugin
    fiftyone plugins disable <name>

    # Disable multiple plugins
    fiftyone plugins disable <name1> <name2> ...

    # Disable all plugins
    fiftyone plugins disable --all

.. note::

    Operators associated with disabled plugins will not appear in the App's
    :ref:`operator browser <using-operators>`.

Plugin disablement is stored as an `enabled: false` entry in the plugin's
:ref:`config settings <plugins-configuration>`.

.. code-block:: shell

    fiftyone plugins disable @voxel51/zoo
    fiftyone app config plugins

.. code-block:: text

    {
        "map": {
            "mapboxAccessToken": "XXXXXXXX"
        },
        "@voxel51/zoo": {
            "enabled": false
        },
        ...
    }

Deleting plugins
----------------

You can use the
:ref:`fiftyone plugins delete <cli-fiftyone-plugins-delete>` command to delete
plugins from your local machine.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Delete a plugin from local disk
    fiftyone plugins delete <name>

.. code-block:: shell

    # Delete multiple plugins from local disk
    fiftyone plugins delete <name1> <name2> ...

.. code-block:: shell

    # Delete all plugins from local disk
    fiftyone plugins delete --all

.. _plugins-configuration:

Configuring plugins
___________________

Certain plugins support configuration. For those plugins, you can store:

-   System-wide plugin settings under the `plugins` key of your
    :ref:`App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`
-   Dataset-specific plugin settings for any subset of the above values on a
    :ref:`dataset's App config <dataset-app-config>`.

See the :ref:`configuring plugins <configuring-plugins>` page for more
information.

.. _plugins-secrets:

Plugin secrets
______________

Some plugins may require sensitive information such as API tokens and login
credentials in order to function. Any secrets that a plugin requires are
documented under the `secrets` key of its `fiftyone.yml` file.

For example, the
`@voxel51/annotation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/annotation/fiftyone.yml>`_
plugin declares the following secrets:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    secrets:
      - FIFTYONE_CVAT_URL
      - FIFTYONE_CVAT_USERNAME
      - FIFTYONE_CVAT_PASSWORD
      - FIFTYONE_LABELBOX_URL
      - FIFTYONE_LABELBOX_API_KEY
      - FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_URL
      - FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_API_KEY

.. note::

    You can use the :ref:`fiftyone plugins info <cli-fiftyone-plugins-info>`
    CLI command to print information about a plugin, including its required
    secrets.

As the naming convention implies, any necessary secrets are provided by setting
environment variables with the appropriate names. For example, if you want to
use the CVAT backend with the
`@voxel51/annotation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/annotation/fiftyone.yml>`_
plugin, you would set:

.. code-block:: shell

    FIFTYONE_CVAT_URL=...
    FIFTYONE_CVAT_USERNAME=...
    FIFTYONE_CVAT_PASSWORD=...

At runtime, the plugin's execution context will automatically be hydrated with
any available secrets that are declared by the plugin. Operators access these
secrets via the `ctx.secrets` dict:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def execute(self, ctx):
        url = ctx.secrets["FIFTYONE_CVAT_URL"]
        username = ctx.secrets["FIFTYONE_CVAT_USERNAME"]
        password = ctx.secrets["FIFTYONE_CVAT_PASSWORD"]

.. _using-panels:

Using panels
____________

Panels are miniature full-featured data applications that you can open in
:ref:`App Spaces <app-spaces>` and interactively manipulate to explore your
dataset and update/respond to updates from other spaces that are currently open
in the App.

FiftyOne natively includes the following Panels:

-   :ref:`Samples panel <app-samples-panel>`: the media grid that loads by
    default when you launch the App
-   :ref:`Histograms panel <app-histograms-panel>`: a dashboard of histograms
    for the fields of your dataset
-   :ref:`Embeddings panel <app-embeddings-panel>`: a canvas for working with
    :ref:`embeddings visualizations <brain-embeddings-visualization>`
-   :ref:`Map panel <app-map-panel>`: visualizes the geolocation data of
    datasets that have a |GeoLocation| field

Any plugins that you've installed may expose additional panels too.

Click the `+` icon next to the "Samples" tab to open a new panel:

.. image:: /images/app/app-map-panel.gif
    :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? You can also programmatically configure spaces
    :ref:`in Python <app-spaces-python>`.

.. _using-operators:

Using operators
_______________

Operators are a powerful feature in FiftyOne that allow plugin developers to
define custom operations that can be executed from within the App.

Some operators may expose themselves as custom buttons, icons, or menu items
throughout the App. However, the Operator Browser allows users to search
through all available (enabled) operators.

You can open the Operator Browser by clicking on the Operator Browser icon
above the sample grid or by typing backtick (`````):

.. image:: /images/plugins/operator-browser.gif
    :align: center

Operators provide dynamic input forms that collect the necessary user inputs.
The actual operation is then performed by pressing the `Execute`/`Schedule`
button at the bottom of the form.

Some Operators perform an immediate action when executed, while other Operators
:ref:`delegate <delegated-operations>` their execution to another process.

.. _executing-operators-sdk:

Executing operators via SDK
___________________________

Many operators are intended to be executed programmatically via the SDK rather
than (or in addition to) executing them by filling out their input form in the
App.

.. _calling-operators:

Calling operators
-----------------

By convention, operators that are intended to be executed programmatically
should implement `__call__()` so that users have a well-documented interface
for invoking the operator as a function.

For example, the
`@voxel51/utils/compute_metadata <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/utils>`_
operator can be invoked like so:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.operators as foo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    compute_metadata = foo.get_operator("@voxel51/utils/compute_metadata")

    # Schedule a delegated operation to (re)compute metadata
    compute_metadata(dataset, overwrite=True, delegate=True)

.. note::

    Notice that :func:`get_operator() <fiftyone.operators.get_operator>` is
    used to retrieve the operator by its URI.

Behind the scenes, the operator's `__call__()` method is implemented as
follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    class ComputeMetadata(foo.Operator):
        def __call__(
            self,
            sample_collection,
            overwrite=False,
            num_workers=None,
            delegate=False,
        ):
            ctx = dict(view=sample_collection.view())
            params = dict(
                overwrite=overwrite,
                num_workers=num_workers,
                delegate=delegate,
            )
            return foo.execute_operator(self.uri, ctx, params=params)

which simply packages up the provided keyword arguments into the correct format
for the operator's `ctx.params` and then passes them to
:func:`execute_operator() <fiftyone.operators.execute_operator>`, which
performs the execution.

.. _delegating-function-calls:

Delegating function calls
-------------------------

The
`@voxel51/utils/delegate <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/utils>`_
operator provides a general purpose utility for
:ref:`delegating execution <delegated-operations>` of an arbitrary function
call that can be expressed in any of the following forms:

-   Execute an arbitrary function: `fcn(*args, **kwargs)`
-   Apply a function to a dataset or view:
    `fcn(dataset_or_view, *args, **kwargs)`
-   Call an instance method of a dataset or view:
    `dataset_or_view.fcn(*args, **kwargs)`

Here's some examples of delegating common tasks that can be expressed in the
above forms:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.operators as foo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    delegate = foo.get_operator("@voxel51/utils/delegate")

    # Compute metadata
    delegate("compute_metadata", dataset=dataset)

    # Compute visualization
    delegate(
        "fiftyone.brain.compute_visualization",
        dataset=dataset,
        brain_key="img_viz",
    )

    # Export a view
    delegate(
        "export",
        view=dataset.to_patches("ground_truth"),
        export_dir="/tmp/patches",
        dataset_type="fiftyone.types.ImageClassificationDirectoryTree",
        label_field="ground_truth",
    )

    # Load the exported patches into a new dataset
    delegate(
        "fiftyone.Dataset.from_dir",
        dataset_dir="/tmp/patches",
        dataset_type="fiftyone.types.ImageClassificationDirectoryTree",
        label_field="ground_truth",
        name="patches",
        persistent=True,
    )

.. _direct-operator-execution:

Direct execution
----------------

You can also programmatically execute any operator by directly calling
:func:`execute_operator() <fiftyone.operators.execute_operator>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.operators as foo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    ctx = {
        "view": dataset.take(10),
        "params": dict(
            export_type="LABELS_ONLY",
            dataset_type="COCO",
            labels_path=dict(absolute_path="/tmp/coco/labels.json"),
            label_field="ground_truth",
            delegate=False,  # False: execute immediately, True: delegate
        )
    }

    result = foo.execute_operator("@voxel51/io/export_samples", ctx)

In the above example, the `delegate=True/False` parameter controls whether
execution happens immediately or is
:ref:`delegated <operator-delegated-execution>` because the operator implements
its
:meth:`resolve_delegation() <fiftyone.operators.operator.Operator.resolve_delegation>`
as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def resolve_delegation(self, ctx):
        return ctx.params.get("delegate", False)

.. note::

    In general, to use
    :func:`execute_operator() <fiftyone.operators.execute_operator>` you must
    inspect the operator's
    :meth:`execute() <fiftyone.operators.operator.Operator.execute>`
    implementation to understand what parameters are required.

.. _requesting-operator-delegation:

Requesting delegation
---------------------

If an operation supports both immediate and delegated execution as specified
either by its :ref:`configuration <operator-delegation-configuration>` or
:ref:`execution options <operator-execution-options>`, you can request
delegated execution by passing the `request_delegation=True` flag to
:func:`execute_operator() <fiftyone.operators.execute_operator>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    foo.execute_operator(operator_uri, ctx=ctx, request_delegation=True)

This has the same effect as choosing `Schedule` from the dropdown in the
operator's input modal when executing it from within the App:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/operator-execute-button.png
    :align: center

.. note::

    :ref:`FiftyOne Teams <fiftyone-teams>` users can also specify an optional
    delegation target for their delegated operations:

    .. code-block:: python

        foo.execute_operator(
            operator_uri,
            ctx=ctx,
            request_delegation=True,
            delegation_target="overnight",
        )

Delegated operations
____________________

Delegated operations are a powerful feature of FiftyOne's plugin framework that
allows you to schedule tasks from within the App that are executed on a
connected workflow orchestrator like
:ref:`Apache Airflow <delegated-operations-airflow>` or run just
:ref:`run locally <delegated-operations-local>` in a separate process.

For example, have model predictions on your dataset that you want to evaluate?
The `@voxel51/evaluation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/evaluation/README.md>`_
plugin makes it easy:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/evaluation.gif

Need to compute embedding for your dataset so you can visualize them in the
:ref:`Embeddings panel <app-embeddings-panel>`? Kick off the task with the
`@voxel51/brain <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/brain/README.md>`_
plugin and proceed with other work while the execution happens in the background:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/embeddings.gif

Why is this awesome? Your AI stack needs a flexible data-centric component that
enables you to organize and compute on your data. With delegated operations,
FiftyOne becomes both a dataset management/visualization tool and a workflow
automation tool that defines how your data-centric workflows like ingestion,
curation, and evaluation are performed.

.. _managing-delegated-operations:

Managing delegated operations
_____________________________

The :ref:`fiftyone delegated <cli-fiftyone-delegated>` CLI command contains a
number of useful utilities for viewing the status of your delegated operations.

Listing delegated operations
----------------------------

You can use the :ref:`fiftyone delegated list <cli-fiftyone-delegated-list>`
command to list the delegated operations that you've run:

.. code-block:: shell

    # List all delegated operations
    fiftyone delegated list

.. code-block:: shell

    # List some specific delegated operations
    fiftyone delegated list \
        --dataset quickstart \
        --operator @voxel51/io/export_samples \
        --state COMPLETED \
        --sort-by COMPLETED_AT \
        --limit 10

Getting delegated operation info
--------------------------------

You can use the
:ref:`fiftyone delegated info <cli-fiftyone-delegated-info>` command to view
the available metadata about a delegated operation, including its inputs,
execution status, and error stack trace, if applicable.

.. code-block:: text

    # Print information about a delegated operation
    fiftyone delegated info <id>

Cleaning up delegated operations
--------------------------------

You can use the
:ref:`fiftyone delegated cleanup <cli-fiftyone-delegated-cleanup>` command to
cleanup delegated operations:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Delete all failed operations associated with a given dataset
    fiftyone delegated cleanup --dataset quickstart --state FAILED

.. code-block:: shell

    # Delete all delegated operations associated with non-existent datasets
    fiftyone delegated cleanup --orphan

.. code-block:: shell

    # Print information about operations rather than actually deleting them
    fiftyone delegated cleanup --orphan --dry-run

.. _delegated-orchestrator:

Setting up an orchestrator
__________________________

.. _delegated-operations-local:

Local execution
---------------

The simplest way to execute delegated operations is to launch a delegated
operation service via the
:ref:`fiftyone delegated launch <cli-fiftyone-delegated-launch>` CLI command:

.. code-block:: shell

    fiftyone delegated launch

This command starts a service that will continuously check for any queued
delegated operations and execute them serially in its process.

.. _delegated-operations-airflow:

Apache Airflow
--------------

Delegated operations are also designed to be executed by workflow orchestration
tools like `Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org>`_.

You can set up Airflow as an orchestrator to run delegated operations in a
development environment by following these steps:

-   Install
    `Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/index.html>`_
-   Install a
    `FiftyOne Airflow DAG <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/orchestrators/airflow>`_
-   Ensure that your :ref:`plugins directory <plugins-directory>` is available,
    either by installing them on the same machine or by making them available
    via a shared filesystem
-   Configure your :ref:`MongoDB connection <configuring-mongodb-connection>`
-   You're all set. Schedule those operations!
