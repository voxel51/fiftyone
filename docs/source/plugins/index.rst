FiftyOne Plugins
================

.. default-role:: code

In the context of FiftyOne, a plugin is a powerful way to extend and customize the functionality of the tool to suit your specific needs. At its core, a plugin consists of Operators and Components.

Operators are user-facing operations that allow you to interact with the data in your dataset. They can range from simple actions like checking a checkbox to more complex workflows such as requesting annotation of samples from a configurable backend. Operators can even be composed of other operators or be used to add functionality to custom Panels and Visualizers.

Components, on the other hand, are responsible for rendering and event handling. They provide the necessary functionality to display and interact with your plugin in the FiftyOne App. Components also implement form inputs and output rendering for Operators, making it possible to customize the way an operator is rendered in the FiftyOne App.

Together, Operators and Components form the building blocks of a plugin, enabling you to tailor FiftyOne to your specific use case and workflow. Whether you're working with images, videos, or other data types, a plugin can help you streamline your machine learning workflows and achieve better results.

What you can and cannot do with plugins?
----------------------------------------

Plugins in FiftyOne are a powerful way to extend and customize the functionality of the tool to suit your specific needs. With plugins, you can add new functionality to the FiftyOne App, render custom panels, and add custom buttons to menus. You can even add custom options to built-in options with Operators and execute custom Python code.

However, there are also certain limitations to keep in mind when working with plugins. For example, plugins cannot add functionality to the SDK or trigger app functionality directly from a Python session or notebook. You also cannot customize built-in menus or options, or override the sidebar, viewbar, or samples grid.

Despite these limitations, plugins still offer a wide range of possibilities for customizing your FiftyOne experience. Whether you're looking to add your own panel, customize how samples are visualized or streamline your workflows.

Python and JavaScript Plugins
-----------------------------

FiftyOne supports two types of plugins: JS Plugins and Python Plugins.

JS Plugins are built using the @fiftyone TypeScript packages, npm packages, and your own TypeScript. They consist of Operators, Panels, Visualizers, and Components. Panels are a blank canvas that JS Plugins can use to render content, while Visualizers allow JS Plugins to override the built-in sample visualizer.

On the other hand, Python Plugins are built using the FiftyOne Python SDK, pip packages, and your own Python. Python plugins can only define Operators.

Component Types
---------------

Plugins may register components to add or customize functionality within the FiftyOne App. Each component is registered with an activation function. The component will only be considered for rendering when the activation function returns true.

 - :class:`Panel` - JS plugins can register a panel component, that is available from the “new panel” action menu
 - :class:`Visualizer` - JS plugins can register a component that will override the built in visualizer (when active)
 - :class:`Component` - JS plugins can register generic components that can be used to render operator input and output

Plugin Settings
---------------

Python and JS plugins can read their settings at the dataset scope or app scope, allowing users to configure plugins in ways that match their workflows. This allows for settings that may correspond to data such as the default camera position in the Looker3D plugin.

.. note::

    Settings are readable by users in the browser. Use environment variables and Python Operators for sensitive/secret values.


Operators
---------

Operators are a powerful feature in FiftyOne that allow plugin developers to define custom operations that can be executed by users of the FiftyOne App. They can be defined in either Python or JS, and are typically triggered by the user clicking a button or using the Operator Browser. Operators can execute other operators and custom code with custom dependencies.

The Operator Browser allows users to search through all available operations without having to find them in a menu or remember the corresponding keyboard shortcuts. You can open the Operator Browser using the "\`" key or by clicking on the Operator Browser icon in the Samples Grid.

Instead of building a user interface from scratch, Operators are built using Operator Types, which define the input and output properties of the operator. At runtime, these types are used to facilitate the execution of the operation by collecting information from the user, validating the user input, and executing the operation. The execution step is the only required step; all other steps are optional and can be customized as needed.

Operators can be composed for coordination between Python and the Fiftyone App, such as triggering a reload of samples/view to update the app with the changes made by the operator. Operators can also be executed from code and triggered by other operators.

Operator Inputs and Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An operator consists of a Definition and a method that executes the operation. The Definition object defines the input and output properties of the operator using Operator Types. At runtime the Definition object is used to facilitate the execution of the operation by a user in the following basic steps:

1. Render a prompt to collect information from the user needed to execute the operation
2. As the user inputs information, and based on the user input aka “params”
   a. Resolve the definition of the input, allowing the form to change based on the user input
   b. Validate the user input
3. Execute the operation
   a. Return a “result”
4. Resolve the output definition based on the params and result of the operation
5. Render the output


Besides step 3, the execution step, all of the above steps will depend on the details of the operator implementation and are optional.

Operator Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:mod:`Python API Reference <fiftyone.operators.types>`
:mod:`Typescript API Reference <@fiftyone/operators>`

The operator definition is constructed using the types defined below. A typical example would be as follows, which defines the input for an operator that accepts a choice rendered as a radio button group:

.. code-block:: python

    inputs = types.Object()
    choices = types.RadioGroup(label="Choose a Color")
    choices.add("red", label="Red")
    choices.add("blue", label="Blue")
    inputs.enum("color", choices.values(), view=choices)

Operator Composition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operators in FiftyOne are used to execute operations on datasets and samples, and can return meaningful results. Operators can be used for a variety of use cases, including querying datasets, mutating samples, and triggering external orchestrations.

In some cases, coordination between operators is necessary. For example, when a Python operator requires some code to be executed in the app after its own execution. In such cases, an operator can trigger another operator to be executed using the ctx.trigger() method of the ExecutionContext. This is commonly used to reload samples/views and update the app with the changes made by the operator.

Operator Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an operator’s execute() method throws an error it will be returned to the browser and display as a result.

Executing Operators from Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of operator type, all operators can be executed from code. For example, a python operator can be executed from JS. To execute an operator you must provide an object that matches the properties the operator defines. When an operator is executed via UI, that object and the execution of that operator is handled by the plugin system.

 - JS to JS
 - JS to Py
 - JS to Py to JS
 - NOT JS to Py to Py
 - NOT Py to Py
 - NOT Py to JS

Placements (Menus and Options)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following images and titles correspond to the available menu ids. MenuItem operators are appended to the specified menu id.

 - SampleActions
 - SampleModalActions

Plugin Runtime
--------------

How are plugins executed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In JS, plugins are loaded from the FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR into the browser. The fiftyone app server finds these plugins by looking for package.json files that include fiftyone as a property. This fiftyone property describes where the plugin executable (dist) is.

For Python plugins there are two ways to execute a plugin.


Python Local Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running the fiftyone app server locally, the plugin server is executed as a subprocess. This subprocess is a python process that runs the plugin server. The plugin server is responsible for loading plugins and executing them. The plugin server is only accessible via ipc. Its interface (similar to JSON rpc) allows for functions to be called over inter process communication. This allows for user python code to be isolated from core code. It also allows for the operating system to manage the separate process as it exists in the same process tree as the root fiftyone, ipython, or even Jupyter process.

As part of running the fiftyone app server (either locally or in the teams environment) a sub process is executed called the plugin server. This server is only accessible via ipc. Its interface (similar to JSON rpc) allows for functions to be called over inter process communication. This allows for user python code to be isolated from core code. It also allows for the operating system to manage the separate process as it exists in the same process tree as the root fiftyone, ipython, or even Jupyter process.

Executing Brain Methods and other Long Running Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Fiftyone Teams environments, python operators may still use local execution for simple operations such as queries, tagging, mutating samples, annotation runs, short imports or exports. However for most interesting operations (computing similarity or mistakenness, computing visualizations), long running task orchestration is required. For this we recommend Apache Airflow, although similar tools can be used instead.

A typical long running operation would look like this:

1. Operators are registered in the local execution environment
2. Browser fetches description of all registered operators
3. Browser requests execution of a long running operator
4. Local execution environment executes the operator
5. Operator makes API request to airflow or another data orchestration platform to schedule a long running task
   a. Operator returns a unique identifier, that is used to reference this long running task
6. Browser requests updates on status via an operator that in turn calls the airflow status API
    a. Browser correlates the previous execution using unique identifier it stored earlier
    b. Browser displays status of all relevant tasks

Fiftyone Teams
--------------

Plugin Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Fiftyone teams, administrators can upload a zip file containing their JS or Python plugins. After a plugin is created within Fiftyone Teams, an administrator can enable or disable the plugin. They can also define permissions required to execute python operators.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Python operators are listed based on the role defined by the administrator who configured the operators access. In order for a user to execute a python operator, the user will also need the dataset permission defined by the administrator.

Setting up your Plugin Directory
--------------------------------

First, create a directory where you want to store your plugins.

Subsequently, when running FiftyOne, you must specify the location of this
directory by setting the `FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR` environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/your/plugins

You can also permanently configure this directory by adding it to your
:ref:`FiftyOne config <configuring-fiftyone>`.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "plugins_dir": "/path/to/your/plugins"
    }

If you are running an instance of your FiftyOne App server, you will need to
restart it to pick up this new setting.

.. note::

    Your plugins directory must be readable by the FiftyOne server.

Installing plugins manually
---------------------------

Fiftyone will try and find your plugin's `fiftyone.yaml` file within the plugin
directory described above. Below is an example of a typical plugin directory.

.. code-block:: text

    /my-fiftyone-plugins
      /my-plugin-1
        /package.json
        /fiftyone.yaml
        /dist
          /my-plugin.min.js
      /my-plugin-2
        /fiftyone-plugin.yaml
        /__init__.py

In order to manually install a plugin, you must copy the plugin's source directory
into your plugin directory so that it matches the structure above.

If your FiftyOne App server is already running, you should restart the server
and refresh any connected browser clients to see the plugins show up.

.. note::

    If you do not see your plugin, make sure the `fiftyone.yaml` file is
    present and defines all operators (python) and scripts (js).

Installing plugins via CLI or Python
------------------------------------

TBD

Configuring plugins
-------------------

You can store system-wide plugin configurations under the plugins key of your
App config or dataset. This allows for configuring plugins at the application
wide level or per dataset.

See the :ref:`configuring plugins <configuring-plugins>` page for more
information on changing a plugin's configuration.

.. note::

    You can see an example of dataset level plugin configuration on the
    :ref:`map panel page <app-map-panel>`.

Developing plugins
------------------

In order to develop and test your plugin you will need the following:

-   A development install of FiftyOne
-   The FiftyOne App setup for development
-   A plugin skeleton (start with one of the plugins in
    `voxel51/fiftyone-plugins`)
-   npm link / symlink to the `@fiftyone/plugins` package
-   npm link / symlink to the `@fiftyone/aggregations` package (optional)
-   npm link / symlink to the `@fiftyone/components` package (optional)

.. note::

    You cannot use relative paths to load these modules. They must be loaded
    using the `from '@fiftyone/$PKG_NAME'` syntax. This allows the build to
    externalize them, so they are loaded at runtime by the parent application.

For local testing, follow these basic steps:

First ensure your plugin's `package.json` includes the path to the plugin
script:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "fiftyone": {
            "script": "dist/index.umd.js"
        }
    }

Then follow the steps below, in separate terminal sessions as needed.

.. code-block:: shell

    # tell FiftyOne where you want to load plugins from
    # this should be the parent directory to all your plugins
    FIFTYONE_PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/your/plugins

    # start the FiftyOne App in dev mode
    cd $FIFTYONE/app/packages/app
    yarn dev

    # start the FiftyOne python server (in a separate session)
    cd $FIFTYONE
    python fiftyone/server/main.py

    # ensure your plugin has a symlink to the @fiftyone/plugins package
    cd $FIFTYONE/app/packages/plugins
    npm link
    cd $MY_PLUGIN
    npm link @fiftyone/plugins

    # note: if you are using other @fiftyone/* packages
    # you will need to follow the same linking steps for those packages

    # now you can build your plugin for development
    yarn build

You should now have a running FiftyOne server and App, including your plugin.

.. note::

    Each time you change you plugin's source you must rebuild using
    `yarn build`. You can setup a watcher to do this automatically. See
    `nodemon <https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon>`_.

Publishing your plugin
----------------------

TBD

How to write plugins
--------------------

Creating your first plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you define any piece of a plugin, such as an operator or panel, you must first create a `fiftyone.yml` file in the root of your plugin directory.

.. code-block:: yaml

    fiftyone:
        # using semver, describe the compatible range of fiftyone versions
        version: '~0.21.0'
    name: "@my-org/my-plugin"
    # JS plugins must include a script path to their bundle
    js_bundle: "dist/index.umd.js"
    description: "My plugin description"
    # in order to load python operators they must be defined in the list below
    operators:
        - my_operator

For Python plugins, you must include a `__init__.py` file. Below is a simple example.

.. code-block:: python

    # __init__.py
    import fiftyone.operators as foo
    import fiftyone.operators.types as types

    class Count(foo.Operator):
        @property
        def config(self):
            return foo.OperatorConfig(name="count", label="Count")

        def execute(self, ctx):
            return {"count": len(ctx.view)}
        
        def resolve_output(self, ctx):
            outputs = types.Object()
            outputs.int("count")
            return types.Property(outputs)

    def register(p):
        p.register(Count)


For both JS and Python plugins, you can use the `Hello World <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/packages/hello-world>`_ as a starting point.

Below are introductory examples to the FiftyOne plugin API.

Building Operators
------------------

Example Python Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to define a simple operator that accepts a string input.

Typically an operator would use the input to perform some operation on the dataset or samples. In this case, we simply return the input string as the output.

With this `OperatorConfig` we cannot dynamically specify the input. We'll cover that in another example below.

.. code-block:: python

    class SimpleInputExample(foo.Operator):
        @property
        def config(self):
            return foo.OperatorConfig(
                name="example_simple_input",
                label="Examples: Simple Input",
            )
        
        def resolve_input(self, ctx):
            inputs = types.Object()
            inputs.str("message", label="Message", required=True)
            header = "Simple Input Example"
            return types.Property(inputs, view=types.View(label=header))

        def execute(self, ctx):
            return {"message": ctx.params["message"]}
        
        def resolve_output(self, ctx):
            outputs = types.Object()
            outputs.str("message", label="Message")
            header = "Simple Input Example: Success!"
            return types.Property(outputs, view=types.View(label=header))

    def register(p):
        # NOTE: make sure to include your operator name
        # in your fiftyone.yaml's operators list
        p.register(SimpleInputExample)

Hello world Operator - JS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to the example above, this JS example shows how to define a simple operator that accepts a string input.

.. note::
    
    The JS and Python API for implementing operators is very similar.
    
Unlike Python operators, JS operators can use React hooks and the `@fiftyone/*` packages by defining a `useHook()` method.
Any values return in this method will be available to the operator's `execute()` method via `ctx.hooks`.

Also shown in the example below is the `unlisted` config option. In both JS and Python operators, this allows for operators to be ommitted from the Operator Browser.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import {Operator, OperatorConfig, types, registerOperator} from "@fiftyone/operators";
    const PLUGIN_NAME = "@my-org/my-plugin";

    class SetSelectedSamples extends Operator {
        get config(): OperatorConfig {
            return new OperatorConfig({
                name: "set_selected_samples",
                label: "Set selected samples",
                unlisted: true
            });
        }
        useHooks(): {} {
            return {
                setSelected: fos.useSetSelected(),
            };
        }
        async execute({ hooks, params }: ExecutionContext) {
            hooks.setSelected(params.samples);
        }
    }

    registerOperator(SetSelectedSamples, PLUGIN_NAME);

Using the Execution Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The execution context is passed to the operator's `execute()` method. It contains the following properties:

- `params` - the operator's input values 
- `dataset` - the current :class:`fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset` instance
- `view` - the current :class:`fiftyone.core.view.DatasetView` instance
- `dataset_name` - the name of the current dataset
- `hooks` - JS Only - the return value of the operator's `useHooks()` method


Panels, Visualizers, and Custom Components
------------------------------------------

Below are examples of how add your own customer user interface and components to the FiftyOne App.

Hello world Panel - JS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple hello world JS plugin, that renders "hello world" in a panel, would look
like this:

.. code-block:: jsx

    import { registerComponent, PluginComponentTypes } from "@fiftyone/plugins";

    function HelloWorld() {
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
    }

    registerComponent({
        copmponent: HelloWorld,
        type: PluginComponentTypes.Panel,
    });

Adding a custom FiftyOne Visualizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: jsx

    import * as fop from "@fiftyone/plugins";
    import * as fos from "@fiftyone/visualizer";

    function PointCloud({ src }) {
        // TODO: implement your visualizer using React
    }

    // this separate components shows where the FiftyOne plugin
    // dependent code ends and the pure react code begins
    function CustomVisualizer({ sample }) {
        const src = fos.getSampleSrc(sample.filepath);
        // now that we have all the data we need
        // we can delegate to code that doesn't depend
        // on the FiftyOne plugin API
        return <PointCloud src={src} />;
    }

    fop.registerComponent({
        // component to delegate to
        copmponent: CustomVisualizer,
        // tell FiftyOne you want to provide a Visualizer
        type: PluginComponentTypes.Visualizer,
        // activate this plugin when the mediaType is PointCloud
        activator: ({ dataset }) => dataset.mediaType === "PointCloud",
    });

Adding a custom Plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: jsx

    import * as fop from "@fiftyone/plugins";
    import * as fos from "@fiftyone/state";
    import * as foa from "@fiftyone/aggregations";
    import AwesomeMap from "react-mapping-library";

    function CustomPlot() {
        const dataset = useRecoilValue(fos.dataset);
        const view = useRecoilValue(fos.view);
        const filters = useRecoilValue(fos.filters);
        const [aggregate, points, loading] = foa.useAggregation({
            dataset,
            filters,
            view,
        });

        React.useEffect(() => {
            aggregate(
                [
                    new foa.aggregations.Values({
                        fieldOrExpr: "id",
                    }),
                    new foa.aggregations.Values({
                        fieldOrExpr: "location.point.coordinates",
                    }),
                ],
                dataset.name
            );
        }, [dataset, filters, view]);

        if (loading) return <h1>Loading</h1>;

        return <MyMap geoPoints={points} />;
    }

    fop.registerComponent({
        // component to delegate to
        copmponent: CustomPlot,
        // tell FiftyOne you want to provide a custom Panel
        type: PluginComponentTypes.Panel,
        // used for the plot selector button
        label: "Map",
        // only show the Map plot when the dataset has Geo data
        activator: ({ dataset }) => dataset.sampleFields.location,
    });

.. note::

    The `PluginComponentType.Plot` type is deprecated. Use
    `PluginComponentType.Panel` instead.

Fiftyone App State
------------------

There are a few ways to manage the state of your plugin. By default you should defer to existing state management in the FiftyOne App.
For example, if you want to allow users to select samples, you can use the `@fiftyone/state` package:

.. code-block:: jsx

    // note: similar to react hooks, these must be used in the context
    // of a React component

    // select a dataset
    const selectLabel = fos.useOnSelectLabel();

    // in a callback
    selectLabel({ id: "labelId", field: "fieldName" });

The example above shows how you can coordinate or surface existing features of FiftyOne through
your plugin via the `@fiftyone/state` package. This package provides hooks to access and modify
the state of the FiftyOne App.

Recoil, Atoms, and Selectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use a combination of your own and fiftyone's recoil `atoms` and `selectors`.

Here's an example the combines both approaches in a hook that you could call from anywhere where hooks are supported (almost all plugin component types).

.. code-block:: jsx

    import {atom, useRecoilValue, useRecoilState} from 'recoil';

    const myPluginmyPluginFieldsState = atom({
        key: 'myPluginFields',
        default: []
    })
    
    function useMyHook() {
        const dataset = useRecoilValue(fos.dataset);
        const [fields, setFields] = useRecoilState(myPluginFieldsState);

        return {
            dataset,
            fields,
            addField: (field) => setFields([...fields, field])
        }
    }

Panel state
-----------

Plugins that provide `PluginComponentTypes.Panel` components should use the
`@fiftyone/spaces` package to manage their state. This package provides hooks
to allow plugins to manage the state of individual panel instances.

.. code-block:: jsx

    import { usePanelStatePartial, usePanelTitle } from "@fiftyone/spaces";
    import { Button } from '@fiftyone/components';

    // in your panel component, you can use the usePanelStatePartial hook
    // to read and write to the panel state
    function MyPanel() {
        const [state, setState] = usePanelStatePartial('choice');
        const setTitle = usePanelTitle();

        React.useEffect(() => {
          setTitle(`My Panel: ${state}`);
        }, [state]);

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Choice: {state}</h1>
            <Button onClick={() => setState('A')}>A</Button>
            <Button onClick={() => setState('B')}>B</Button>
          </div>
        );
    }

Reading settings in your plugin
-------------------------------

Some plugins use libraries or tools that require credentials such as API keys
or tokens. Below is an example for how to provide and read these credentials.

The same mechanism can be used to expose configuration to plugin users, such as
color choices, and default values.

You can store a setting in either the App config or an individual dataset.
Here's an example of both.

.. code-block:: js

    // app_config.json
    {
      "plugins": {
        "my-plugin": {
          "mysetting": "foo"
        }
      }
    }

Now lets take that setting and change it for the `quickstart` dataset.

.. code-block:: py

    import fiftyone as fo
    dataset = fo.load_dataset("quickstart")

    # Modify the dataset's App config
    dataset.app_config.plugins["my-plugin"] = {
      "mysetting": "bar"
    }

    dataset.save()

Then in your plugin implementation, you can read settings with the
`useSettings` hook:

.. code-block:: js

    const { mysetting } = fop.useSettings("my-plugin");

Querying FiftyOne
-----------------

The typical use case for a plugin is to provide a unique way of visualizing
FiftyOne data. However some plugins may need to also fetch data in a unique way
to efficiently visualize it.

For example, a `PluginComponentType.Plot` plugin rendering a map of geo points
may need to fetch data relative to where the user is currently viewing. In
MongoDB, such a query would look like this:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      $geoNear: {
        near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ] },
        maxDistance: 2,
        query: { category: "Parks" },
      }
    }

In a FiftyOne plugin this same query can be performed using the
`useAggregation()` method of the plugin SDK:

.. code-block:: jsx

    import * as fop from "@fiftyone/plugins";
    import * as fos from "@fiftyone/state";
    import * as foa from "@fiftyone/aggregations";
    import * as recoil from "recoil";

    function useGeoDataNear() {
        const dataset = useRecoilValue(fos.dataset);
        const view = useRecoilValue(fos.view);
        const filters = useRecoilValue(fos.filters);
        const [aggregate, points, isLoading] = foa.useAggregation({
            dataset,
            filters,
            view,
        });
        const availableFields = findAvailableFields(dataset.sampleFields);
        const [selectedField, setField] = React.useState(availableFields[0]);

        React.useEffect(() => {
            aggregate([
                new foa.aggregations.Values({
                    fieldOrExpr: "location.point.coordinates",
                }),
            ]);
        }, []);

        return {
            points,
            isLoading,
            setField,
            availableFields,
            selectedField,
        };
    }

    function MapPlugin() {
        const { points, isLoading, setField, availableFields, selectedField } =
            useGeoDataNear();

        return (
            <Map
                points={points}
                onSelectField={(f) => setField(f)}
                selectedField={selectedField}
                locationFields={availableFields}
            />
        );
    }

    fop.registerComponent({
        name: "MapPlugin",
        label: "Map",
        activator: ({ dataset }) => findAvailableFields(dataset.fields).length > 0,
    });
