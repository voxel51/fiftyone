    "# Using Image Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "FiftyOne provides a powerful [embeddings visualization](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#visualizing-embeddings) capability that you can use to generate low-dimensional representations of the samples and objects in your datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook highlights several applications of visualizing image embeddings, with the goal of motivating some of the many possible workflows that you can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading datasets from the [FiftyOne Dataset Zoo](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/dataset_zoo_datasets.html)\n",
    "- Using [compute_visualization()](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/api/fiftyone.brain.html#fiftyone.brain.compute_visualization) to generate 2D representations of images\n",
    "- Providing custom embeddings to [compute_visualization()](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/api/fiftyone.brain.html#fiftyone.brain.compute_visualization)\n",
    "- Visualizing embeddings via [interactive plots](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/plots.html) connected to the [FiftyOne App](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "And we'll demonstrate how to use embeddings to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify anomolous/incorrect image labels\n",
    "- Find examples of scenarios of interest\n",
    "- Pre-annotate unlabeled data for training\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what's the takeaway?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Combing through individual images in a dataset and staring at aggregate performance metrics trying to figure out how to improve the performance of a model is an ineffective and time-consuming process. Visualizing your dataset in a low-dimensional embedding space is a powerful workflow that can reveal patterns and clusters in your data that can answer important questions about the critical failure modes of your model and how to augment your dataset to address these failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the FiftyOne Brain's [embeddings visualization](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#visualizing-embeddings) capability on your ML projects can help you uncover hidden patterns in your data and take action to improve the quality of your datasets and models."
