    "Natural language interfaces (NLIs) allow humans to interact with software systems using everyday language instead of rigid commands, scripts, or UI clicks. Instead of learning a domain-specific API or remembering exact function signatures, you describe what you want to accomplish, and the system translates that intent into concrete actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a natural language interface sits on top of existing tools and workflows. It doesn't replace them—it orchestrates them. The interface parses intent, asks clarifying questions when needed, and executes real operations against real systems. The key difference from chatbots or code generators is execution: a true NLI doesn't just suggest what to do, it actually does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When connected to the right backend, a natural language interface becomes a control plane for complex systems—lowering the barrier to entry without dumbing down what's possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to use [FiftyOne Skills](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-skills) and the [FiftyOne MCP Server](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-mcp-server) with Google's Gemini CLI to build natural language workflows for computer vision tasks.\n",

    "* Understanding what MCP servers and agent skills provide\n",
    "* Installing and configuring the FiftyOne MCP Server with Gemini CLI\n",
    "* Installing FiftyOne Skills for common computer vision workflows\n",
    "* Loading datasets using natural language commands\n",
    "* Running model inference with multiple models\n",
    "* Evaluating model predictions and comparing results\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what's the takeaway?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining FiftyOne's 80+ operators with natural language interfaces, you can dramatically accelerate computer vision workflows. Tasks that previously required writing custom scripts—loading data, running inference, evaluating models—can now be accomplished through simple conversational commands."

    "## Why Natural Language Interfaces Matter for Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision workflows are powerful, but they're also fragmented. Loading datasets, converting formats, running inference, inspecting failures, fixing labels—each step lives in a different tool, file, or script. Even experienced engineers spend more time wrangling data than improving models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language interfaces compress this complexity. They let you express intent instead of implementation: \"Find duplicate images,\" \"Run detection and show false positives,\" \"Visualize embeddings for this class.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For CV teams, this matters because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iteration gets faster**: You move from idea to execution in one step\n",
    "* **Expertise is shared**: Hard-won workflows become reusable instead of tribal knowledge\n",
    "* **More people can contribute**: Researchers, data scientists, and PMs can explore datasets without writing glue code\n",
    "* **Focus shifts to data quality**: The real bottleneck in model performance"

    "## What Are Skills and MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent skills and MCP solve different parts of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is about connection: it lets an agent talk to real systems, run real operations, and get real results instead of just generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills** are about guidance: they teach the agent how to use those capabilities correctly for a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP exposes *what* the system can do, while skills explain *how* and *when* to do it. On their own, tools are powerful but can be ambiguous. Skills turn those tools into repeatable workflows. They encode experience, decisions, and guardrails. Together, they let agents move from \"I can call functions\" to \"I know how to complete this task end to end.\"\n",

    "### FiftyOne MCP Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The [FiftyOne MCP Server](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-mcp-server) connects agents to FiftyOne's 80+ operators, dataset management, model inference, brain computations, and the App. It's the bridge between natural language and FiftyOne tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FiftyOne Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "[FiftyOne Skills](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-skills) are expert workflows built on top of the MCP server. Each skill teaches the agent how to complete a specific task: import data, find duplicates, visualize embeddings. Skills handle the nuances so you don't have to."
