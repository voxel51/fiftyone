   "source": "# Tips and Tricks for Using FiftyOne in Google Colab\n\nWorking with FiftyOne in Google Colab presents unique challenges: temporary instances that lose your data, installation overhead on every restart, and the need to manage datasets across sessions. This notebook shares practical techniques to make your FiftyOne workflow in Colab faster, more reliable, and reproducible.\n\nWe'll cover the following concepts:\n\n- Installing FiftyOne efficiently using modern tools\n- Persisting datasets, models, and configurations across sessions with Google Drive\n- Sharing datasets with collaborators\n- Leveraging GPU acceleration for faster inference\n- Managing the FiftyOne App for a better development experience\n\n**So, what's the takeaway?**\n\nThese patterns apply beyond FiftyOne. The techniques for managing data persistence, sharing resources, and optimizing compute translate to other ML workflows in Colab.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo follow this tutorial, you'll need a Google account with sufficient space on Google Drive (approximately 1 GB)."

   "source": "## Tip 1: Fast and clean FiftyOne installation\n\nUsing `uv` for package installation and `%%capture` to suppress output creates clean and efficient Colab notebooks.\n\nIn Google Colab, the virtual machine instance is temporary. When you close your browser tab or the notebook becomes idle for too long, the instance is recycled and all installed packages are lost. Having a quick way to re-install libraries like FiftyOne is valuable.\n\n### Why use uv?\n\n[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern, fast Python package installer and resolver designed to be significantly quicker than traditional tools like `pip` or `conda`. This is useful in Colab notebooks since they need to be re-configured each time you start a new session.\n\n### Suppressing installation output\n\nThe `%%capture` magic command suppresses the standard output and standard error streams of a cell. When installing packages, the output can be verbose. Using `%%capture` keeps your notebook clean and focused on results.\n\n### Specifying package versions\n\nIt's good practice to make the version of your libraries explicit. This is crucial for reproducibility—different versions can have API changes or different dependencies. By specifying the version, you ensure that anyone running your notebook in the future uses the exact same environment."

This is more immediate than using gdown.\n\nYou can try the following steps using this public access link to COCO-2017 samples: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G6JKGm0sy5d5ViEpDktXMxIqq5cl2Nrc?usp=sharing\n\n### Creating a shortcut\n\n1. Open [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com) and sign in\n2. (Optional) If the folder was shared via invitation, find it under \"Shared with me\"\n3. Right-click on the folder and select **Organize > Add shortcut to Drive**\n\n![add_shortcut](https://cdn.voxel51.com/getting_started_colab_tips/notebook2/add_shortcut.webp)\n\n4. Select a location (e.g., \"My Drive\") and click **Add shortcut**\n5. Access your shortcut—it will be marked with a small arrow icon\n\nYou can then reference this folder in your code:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport os\npath = Path(\"/gdrive/MyDrive/<folder_name>\")\nos.listdir(path)\n```\n\nShortcuts are pointers to the original folder—they don't make copies or use your storage quota. Any changes to files within the shortcut are reflected in the original folder.\n\n### Configuring FiftyOne paths on Drive\n\nSave your FiftyOne downloads, models, and MongoDB database to Drive by modifying the configuration:"

Your token verifies permissions.\n- **Avoid rate limiting**: Authenticated requests have higher download limits.\n- **Upload your work**: Upload and manage models and datasets on the Hub.\n\n### Setting up your token\n\n1. Create an account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/)\n2. Go to **Settings > Access Tokens** and create a new token with \"Write\" role\n3. In Colab, click the **key icon** (🔑) in the left sidebar\n4. Add a new secret named `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` with your token value\n5. Enable \"Notebook access\"\n\n### Using the token\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom google.colab import userdata\n\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\"] = userdata.get('HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN')\n```\n\n**Security tip**: Never expose tokens in plain text. If compromised, revoke immediately in your HuggingFace settings.\n\n### Loading datasets from HuggingFace"
