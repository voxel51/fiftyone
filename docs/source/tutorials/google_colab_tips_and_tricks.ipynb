        "\n",
        "Working with FiftyOne in Google Colab presents unique challenges: temporary instances that lose your data, installation overhead on every restart, and the need to manage datasets across sessions. This notebook shares battle-tested techniques to make your FiftyOne workflow in Colab faster, more reliable, and reproducible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you're curating datasets, running computer vision experiments, or building ML pipelines, these tips will help with your work in the ephemeral Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What you will learn\n",
        "\n",
        "- Install FiftyOne using modern tools like `uv`\n",
        "- Persist your datasets, models, and configurations across sessions with Google Drive\n",
        "- Share datasets with collaborators\n",
        "- Leverage GPU acceleration for faster inference\n",
        "- Control the FiftyOne App for a better development experience\n",

        "### So, what's the takeaway?\n",

        "## Tip 1: Clean and fast FiftyOne installation with `uv` and `%%capture`\n",
        "\n",
        "Using `uv` for package installation and `%%capture` to suppress output are great practices for creating clean and efficient Colab notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Google Colab, the virtual machine instance you are using is temporary. When you close your browser tab or the notebook becomes idle for too long, the instance is recycled and all installed packages are lost. This is why having a quick way to re-install libraries like FiftyOne is very valuable, and `uv` helps significantly with this.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use `uv`?\n",
        "\n",
        "`uv` is a modern, fast Python package installer and resolver. It is designed to be significantly quicker than traditional tools like `conda`. Using `uv` can drastically reduce the time it takes to set up your environment, especially when dealing with many dependencies. This is useful on Colab notebooks, as they need to be re-configured each time that we close the browser window that runs them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use `%%capture`?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `%%capture` magic command is used to suppress the standard output and standard error streams of a cell. When installing packages, the output can often be very verbose. Using `%%capture` keeps your notebook clean and focused on the results of your code, rather than the installation process details.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explicitly specifying package versions\n",
        "\n",
        "It's always a good practice to make the version of the library you are using explicit in your notebook. This is crucial for reproducibility. Different versions of libraries like FiftyOne can have API changes or different dependencies. By specifying the version, you ensure that anyone running your notebook in the future will use the exact same environment you did, saving time and effort in reproducing your work.\n",

        "\n",
        "This cell uses `uv` to install the `fiftyone` library with a specific version (`==1.8.0`). The `!` at the beginning indicates a shell command, and `%%capture` suppresses the installation output."
