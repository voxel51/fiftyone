First, it provided the research community with a common benchmark that was computationally tractable, even early personal computers could train models on MNIST in reasonable time. Second, its simplicity allowed researchers to focus on algorithmic innovations rather than data preprocessing challenges. Landmark achievements in deep learning, from early multilayer perceptrons to convolutional architectures like LeNet-5, were first demonstrated and validated on MNIST.\n",

Many techniques that seem obvious today, like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization, were first explored and validated using MNIST as a testbed.\n",

For newcomers to computer vision, MNIST provides an ideal environment to understand core concepts without overwhelming complexity. The dataset is small enough to experiment with quickly, yet rich enough to demonstrate important phenomena like overfitting, the importance of data augmentation, and the impact of architectural choices.\n",

While a model trained specifically on MNIST might achieve 99%+ accuracy, applying a general-purpose vision model like CLIP without any MNIST-specific training provides insights into how well these models generalize and what they've learned about visual patterns from their massive training datasets.\n",

Traditional computer vision models are trained on fixed sets of image categories, but CLIP was trained on 400 million image-text pairs from the internet, learning to match images with their captions. This training enables CLIP to perform \"zero-shot\" classification: the ability to classify images into categories it has not seen during training by comparing the image representation with text descriptions of potential classes. The model works by encoding both images and text into the same high-dimensional embedding space, where similar concepts cluster together, allowing it to determine which text description best matches a given image through similarity comparison.\n",

        "In [OpenAI's 2021 CLIP paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), the comparison with MNIST revealed fascinating insights about zero-shot learning capabilities. While supervised models trained specifically on MNIST achieve near-perfect accuracy (>99.7%), OpenAI's best performing variant of CLIP (trained on about 400 million image-text pairs) achieved only 88% accuracy on these handwritten digits. This is interesting considering the model was not trained explicitly trained on any variant of this dataset. This comparison highlighted a shift in modern computer vision from specialized models that excel at narrow tasks to general models that perform reasonably well across diverse domains. The 11+ percentage point gap between supervised and zero-shot approaches on MNIST demonstrates both the power and limitations of general-purpose vision-language models, making MNIST an excellent case study for understanding the trade-offs between specialized optimization and general-purpose learning, particularly valuable for exploring modern approaches like few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and transfer learning strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the variant of CLIP that we use in our experiments of this notebook, `\"clip-vit-base32-torch\"` (a Vit-B/32 model) is *not* the top performing variant of CLIP that is showcased on the original OpenAI paper. That would be \"ViT-L/14@336px\", a bigger vision transformer model. The Vit-B/32 base model remains interesting and widely popular due to its lower number of parameters.\n",

        "**Zero-shot classification** leverages pre-trained models like CLIP that have learned rich visual representations from massive datasets, allowing them to classify images into \"interpolated\" categories they've not explicitly seen during training. These models understand the semantic relationship between images and text descriptions, enabling classification through natural language prompts like \"a photo of the digit 3\" without requiring any task-specific training data. In contrast, **traditional supervised training** requires labeled examples for each class you want to predict. You must provide the model with many of images of each digit along with their correct labels, then train the network to learn the mapping from pixel patterns to class labels through backpropagation. While supervised training often achieves higher accuracy on specific datasets and allows for domain-specific optimization, zero-shot approaches offer remarkable flexibility and can instantly work on new classification tasks without additional training time or computational resources."

        "**Limited Training Exposure**: CLIP trained on web-scraped image-text pairs, which contain fewer examples of handwritten digits compared to photographs of everyday objects. The model lacks deep exposure to the subtle variations in handwriting styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scale and Context Mismatch**: CLIP expects high-resolution, colorful images with rich contextual information. MNIST's 28x28 grayscale digits provide minimal visual context that CLIP relies on for classification decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specialized Visual Features**: Handwritten digits require recognition of fine-grained stroke patterns, curves, and connections that differ from the broader visual concepts CLIP learned from natural images. A \"6\" versus \"9\" distinction depends on subtle orientation cues.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Text-Image Alignment**: CLIP's strength lies in matching images with descriptive captions. Simple digit classification lacks the rich semantic relationships between visual and textual information that CLIP exploits in other domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Gap**: This explains why CLIP achieves only ~88% accuracy on MNIST while specialized CNNs reach >99% (on OpenAI's reported experiments using the `ViT-L-14` base for CLIP). The 11+ percentage point gap highlights the trade-off between general-purpose capabilities and domain-specific optimization.\n",

Think of it as evaluating the knowledge of a generalist vs a super-specialized expert on a narrow subject matter.\n",

Despite its age, LeNet-5 perfectly illustrates core CNN concepts including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and the transition from feature extraction to classification.\n",

The network learns low-level features like edges and curves in early layers, then combines these into higher-level digit patterns in deeper layers. This hierarchical feature learning principle underlies virtually all modern CNN architectures.\n",

        "\n",
        "The **validation set** serves as an unbiased evaluation mechanism during model development, acting as a proxy for real-world performance before touching the final test set. While the training set teaches the model to recognize patterns in handwritten digits, the validation set reveals whether the model has truly learned generalizable features or simply memorized the training data, a phenomenon known as overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, we monitor both training and validation **loss** simultaneously. **Loss** is a numerical measure of how far off the model's predictions are from the correct answers - lower loss means better performance. We use categorical cross-entropy loss, which penalizes confident wrong predictions more heavily than uncertain ones. **Training loss** typically decreases steadily as the model learns, but **validation loss** tells the real story. If validation loss plateaus or begins increasing while training loss continues decreasing, the model is overfitting and memorizing training-specific details rather than learning robust digit recognition patterns. This signals when to stop training, adjust hyperparameters, or modify the architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "The validation set also enables **hyperparameter tuning** without contaminating our final evaluation. We can experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, regularization techniques, or architectural modifications, using validation loss to guide these decisions. Each configuration gets evaluated on the same held-out validation data, ensuring fair comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important: the test set remains completely untouched** throughout the development process. Only after we've selected our final model configuration based on validation performance do we evaluate on the test set once, giving us an honest estimate of how the model will perform on truly unseen data. This three-way split (train/validation/test) is fundamental to responsible machine learning development and prevents the subtle \"data leakage\" that can make models appear better than they actually are."

This bridge between FiftyOne's dataset management and PyTorch's training pipeline is important for maintaining both the metadata and annotations while enabling batch processing. PyTorch's `Dataset` class provides a standardized interface for data loading, handling tasks like image loading, preprocessing transforms, and label conversion. By creating a custom dataset class that works with FiftyOne's file paths and labels, we can leverage PyTorch's `DataLoader` for batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading while preserving all the dataset analysis capabilities that FiftyOne provides.

        "**Why Standard Scaling Matters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gradient Optimization**: Neural networks learn through gradient descent, which works best when input features are on similar scales. Without scaling, features with larger magnitudes (like raw pixel values 0-255) can dominate the gradient updates, leading to slower convergence and unstable training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weight Initialization Compatibility**: Modern weight initialization schemes (Xavier, He initialization) assume inputs are roughly centered around zero with unit variance. Standard scaling ensures our data matches these assumptions, preventing vanishing or exploding gradients during early training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Activation Function Efficiency**: Many activation functions (tanh, sigmoid) work optimally when inputs are centered around zero. Scaled inputs help neurons operate in the most responsive regions of these functions rather than saturating in flat regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Rate Stability**: With standardized inputs, we can use higher learning rates without instability, as the optimization landscape becomes more uniform across different dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For MNIST images, we transform raw pixel values from the range [0, 255] to approximately [-1, 1] with mean ≈ 0, creating a more favorable training environment that typically results in faster convergence and better final performance.\n"

        "The principle behind effective augmentation is creating realistic variations that preserve the digit's identity while exposing the model to plausible distortions. MNIST digits are centered and normalized, so augmentations should introduce controlled variability without making digits unrecognizable.\n",
        "### Augmentations to Avoid\n",
        "* Heavy distortions like large rotations (>20°), extreme scaling, or aggressive elastic deformation can make digits ambiguous, a rotated \"6\" might look like a \"9\", or a heavily stretched \"1\" might resemble a \"7\".\n",
        "\n",
        "* Color-based augmentations (brightness, contrast) have limited benefit since MNIST is grayscale and already normalized."

        "Careful data augmentation has the potential to help with misclassified samples: By specifically targeting the samples that our model struggled with during initial training, we can create additional training examples that help the model learn to handle these edge cases more effectively. However we must do this carefully in order to not damage the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small rotations and elastic deformations are effective for handwritten digits: These transformations mimic natural variations in human handwriting without making digits ambiguous. The key is finding the right balance: enough variation to improve robustness, but not so much that a \"6\" looks like a \"9\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning with augmented data can improve model robustness: Rather than training from scratch, fine-tuning the already-trained model with augmented versions of problematic samples allows us to specifically address weaknesses while preserving the knowledge already learned.\n",

This is evident due to the corrupted data that we have found on the test set, but this can't be proven unless we check their training workflow. **Can you achieve a 1.0 accuracy score after removing the low quality samples from the test set?** It's good to think about what we have done as an iteration in an open problem. The MNIST dataset could definitely be cleaner.\n",

        "\n",

        "You explored two distinct paradigms for image classification on MNIST. CLIP demonstrated zero-shot capabilities through visual-language alignment, achieving a limited level accuracy (without requiring any training). LeNet-5 required supervised training but enabled targeted fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow revealed that embeddings expose semantic structure in our data, enabling clustering analysis, outlier detection, and similarity search. Metrics like uniqueness, representativeness, and hardness guided strategic data curation decisions. Visual debugging through FiftyOne exposed model weaknesses and validated improvements across training iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data quality emerged as the critical factor. We identified mislabeled samples, found corrupted images in the test set, and discovered that targeted augmentation of difficult samples improved model robustness. The comparison between original and retrained models quantified these improvements and revealed which samples benefited from augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This iterative approach applies beyond MNIST. The combination of embedding analysis, visual debugging, and strategic data curation forms a general framework for improving vision models. Foundation models provide strong baselines for exploration, while supervised models offer fine-grained control when domain-specific optimization matters."
