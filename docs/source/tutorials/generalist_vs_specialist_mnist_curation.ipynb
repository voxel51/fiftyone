First, it provided the research community with a common benchmark that was computationally tractable, even early personal computers could train models on MNIST in reasonable time. Second, its simplicity allowed researchers to focus on algorithmic innovations rather than data preprocessing challenges. Landmark achievements in deep learning, from early multilayer perceptrons to convolutional architectures like LeNet-5, were first demonstrated and validated on MNIST.\n",

        "The dataset served as a proving ground for fundamental concepts of modern computer vision: convolutional neural networks, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms were all tested on these handwritten digits. Many techniques that seem obvious today, like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization, were first explored and validated using MNIST as a testbed.\n",

        "While critics sometimes dismiss MNIST as \"too easy\" for modern standards, it continues to serve crucial educational and research purposes. For newcomers to computer vision, MNIST provides an ideal environment to understand core concepts without overwhelming complexity. The dataset is small enough to experiment with quickly, yet rich enough to demonstrate important phenomena like overfitting, the importance of data augmentation, and the impact of architectural choices.\n",
        "\n",

Traditional computer vision models are trained on fixed sets of image categories, but CLIP was trained on 400 million image-text pairs from the internet, learning to match images with their captions. This training enables CLIP to perform \"zero-shot\" classification: the ability to classify images into categories it has not seen during training by comparing the image representation with text descriptions of potential classes. The model works by encoding both images and text into the same high-dimensional embedding space, where similar concepts cluster together, allowing it to determine which text description best matches a given image through similarity comparison.\n",

        "In [OpenAI's 2021 CLIP paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), the comparison with MNIST revealed fascinating insights about zero-shot learning capabilities. While supervised models trained specifically on MNIST achieve near-perfect accuracy (>99.7%), OpenAI's best performing variant of CLIP (trained on about 400 million image-text pairs) achieved only 88% accuracy on these handwritten digits. This is interesting considering the model was not trained explicitly trained on any variant of this dataset. This comparison highlighted a shift in modern computer vision from specialized models that excel at narrow tasks to general models that perform reasonably well across diverse domains. The 11+ percentage point gap between supervised and zero-shot approaches on MNIST demonstrates both the power and limitations of general-purpose vision-language models, making MNIST an excellent case study for understanding the trade-offs between specialized optimization and general-purpose learning, particularly valuable for exploring modern approaches like few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and transfer learning strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the variant of CLIP that we use in our experiments of this notebook, `\"clip-vit-base32-torch\"` (a Vit-B/32 model) is *not* the top performing variant of CLIP that is showcased on the original OpenAI paper. That would be \"ViT-L/14@336px\", a bigger vision transformer model. The Vit-B/32 base model remains interesting and widely popular due to its lower number of parameters.\n",

The academic community has identified [several of these ambiguous samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05283). These labeling inconsistencies, while representing less than 0.1% of the dataset, provide opportunities to explore data quality assessment techniques.\n",

        "**Zero-shot classification** leverages pre-trained models like CLIP that have learned rich visual representations from massive datasets, allowing them to classify images into \"interpolated\" categories they've not explicitly seen during training. These models understand the semantic relationship between images and text descriptions, enabling classification through natural language prompts like \"a photo of the digit 3\" without requiring any task-specific training data. In contrast, **traditional supervised training** requires labeled examples for each class you want to predict. You must provide the model with many of images of each digit along with their correct labels, then train the network to learn the mapping from pixel patterns to class labels through backpropagation. While supervised training often achieves higher accuracy on specific datasets and allows for domain-specific optimization, zero-shot approaches offer remarkable flexibility and can instantly work on new classification tasks without additional training time or computational resources."

        "**Limited Training Exposure**: CLIP trained on web-scraped image-text pairs, which contain fewer examples of handwritten digits compared to photographs of everyday objects. The model lacks deep exposure to the subtle variations in handwriting styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scale and Context Mismatch**: CLIP expects high-resolution, colorful images with rich contextual information. MNIST's 28x28 grayscale digits provide minimal visual context that CLIP relies on for classification decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specialized Visual Features**: Handwritten digits require recognition of fine-grained stroke patterns, curves, and connections that differ from the broader visual concepts CLIP learned from natural images. A \"6\" versus \"9\" distinction depends on subtle orientation cues.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Text-Image Alignment**: CLIP's strength lies in matching images with descriptive captions. Simple digit classification lacks the rich semantic relationships between visual and textual information that CLIP exploits in other domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Gap**: This explains why CLIP achieves only ~88% accuracy on MNIST while specialized CNNs reach >99% (on OpenAI's reported experiments using the `ViT-L-14` base for CLIP). The 11+ percentage point gap highlights the trade-off between general-purpose capabilities and domain-specific optimization.\n",

This \"zero-shot\" capability allows you to find relevant images without needing to manually annotate them with labels.

While the training set teaches the model to recognize patterns in handwritten digits, the validation set reveals whether the model has truly learned generalizable features or simply memorized the training data, a phenomenon known as overfitting.\n",

We use categorical cross-entropy loss, which penalizes confident wrong predictions more heavily than uncertain ones. **Training loss** typically decreases steadily as the model learns, but **validation loss** tells the real story. If validation loss plateaus or begins increasing while training loss continues decreasing, the model is overfitting and memorizing training-specific details rather than learning robust digit recognition patterns. This signals when to stop training, adjust hyperparameters, or modify the architecture.\n",

Only after we've selected our final model configuration based on validation performance do we evaluate on the test set once, giving us an honest estimate of how the model will perform on truly unseen data. This three-way split (train/validation/test) is fundamental to responsible machine learning development and prevents the subtle \"data leakage\" that can make models appear better than they actually are."

PyTorch's `Dataset` class provides a standardized interface for data loading, handling tasks like image loading, preprocessing transforms, and label conversion. By creating a custom dataset class that works with FiftyOne's file paths and labels, we can leverage PyTorch's `DataLoader` for batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading while preserving all the dataset analysis capabilities that FiftyOne provides.

        "**Why Standard Scaling Matters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gradient Optimization**: Neural networks learn through gradient descent, which works best when input features are on similar scales. Without scaling, features with larger magnitudes (like raw pixel values 0-255) can dominate the gradient updates, leading to slower convergence and unstable training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weight Initialization Compatibility**: Modern weight initialization schemes (Xavier, He initialization) assume inputs are roughly centered around zero with unit variance. Standard scaling ensures our data matches these assumptions, preventing vanishing or exploding gradients during early training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Activation Function Efficiency**: Many activation functions (tanh, sigmoid) work optimally when inputs are centered around zero. Scaled inputs help neurons operate in the most responsive regions of these functions rather than saturating in flat regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Rate Stability**: With standardized inputs, we can use higher learning rates without instability, as the optimization landscape becomes more uniform across different dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For MNIST images, we transform raw pixel values from the range [0, 255] to approximately [-1, 1] with mean ≈ 0, creating a more favorable training environment that typically results in faster convergence and better final performance.\n"

However we must do this carefully in order to not damage the model.\n",

        "Fine-tuning with augmented data can improve model robustness: Rather than training from scratch, fine-tuning the already-trained model with augmented versions of problematic samples allows us to specifically address weaknesses while preserving the knowledge already learned.\n",
        "\n",
        "FiftyOne enables easy tracking of prediction changes across model versions: By storing predictions from both the original and retrained models in the same dataset, we can directly compare performance and identify which specific samples improved or degraded, enabling targeted analysis and further improvements.\n",

        "Now, take a look at the [public leaderboard scores on Kaggle for this problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/leaderboard). How is it possible that some achieve 1.0 accuracy?  It's possible that many people are cheating and using data from the test set into their training (data leakage). This is evident due to the corrupted data that we have found on the test set, but this can't be proven unless we check their training workflow. **Can you achieve a 1.0 accuracy score after removing the low quality samples from the test set?** It's good to think about what we have done as an iteration in an open problem. The MNIST dataset could definitely be cleaner.\n",

        "1. **Sample Quality Analysis**: Notice that we computed the uniqueness, representativeness, and hardness of the samples on the training set. Can you create filtered views of other batches of retraining data based on them?\n",
        "\n",
        "Try:\n",
        "* Selecting the most unique samples or those with highest hardness scores for additional augmentation\n",
        "* Filtering out the most ambiguous or questionable cases out of the fine-tuning training data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Active Learning**: Use the uniqueness, representativeness and hardness metrics to implement an [active learning pipeline](https://voxel51.com/blog/supercharge-your-annotation-workflow-with-active-learning) that selects the most informative samples for manual annotation or additional augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dataset Exploration**: Apply these techniques to other classification datasets like [CIFAR-10](https://docs.voxel51.com/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-cifar10) or [Fashion-MNIST](https://docs.voxel51.com/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-fashion-mnist)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Architecture Comparison**: Implement and compare different CNN architectures (e.g. [Network in Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385)) on MNIST\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Custom Augmentations**: Design and test novel augmentation strategies specific to handwritten digits, try augmenting the dataset [adding colors to the digits](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/colored-mnist) and see how this change impacts the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **CLIP Model Variants and Prompting**: Experiment with different CLIP model variants available in FiftyOne's Model Zoo and compare their zero-shot performance on MNIST. Test how different text prompts affect accuracy across model sizes."
