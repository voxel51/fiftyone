Clustering algorithms take in a bunch of objects, and spit out assignments for each object. Unlike classification, however, clustering does not start with a list of classes to categorize the objects, forcing objects to fall into preset buckets. Rather, clustering attempts to *discover* the buckets given the data. In other words, clustering is about *uncovering* structure in data, not predicting labels in a preexisting structure."

These methods try to find central points by which to define each cluster, called *centroids*, which seek to maximize some notion of coherence between points *within* a cluster. This flavor of clustering scales well to large datasets but is sensitive to outliers and random initialization. Often, multiple runs are performed, and the best one is chosen. You may find that techniques like K-means struggle with high-dimensional data ‚Äî ‚Äúthe curse of dimensionality‚Äù ‚Äî and can better uncover structure when paired with dimensionality reduction techniques like uniform manifold approximation & projection ([UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). We‚Äôll explain how to pair the two below.\n",

Conceptually, these algorithms treat high-density regions as clusters, breaking the clusters off when the points become sufficiently spread out in feature space. Simple density-based techniques like DBSCAN can have difficulty working with high-dimensional data, where data may not be densely colocated. However, more sophisticated techniques like HDBSCAN can overcome some of these limitations and uncover remarkable structure from high dimensional features.\n",

    "1. *Construct* clusters by starting with individual points and iteratively combining clusters into larger composites or \n",
    "2. *Deconstruct* clusters, starting with all objects in one cluster and iteratively diving clusters into smaller components.\n",

    "Constructive techniques like [Agglomerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#hierarchical-clustering) become computationally expensive as the dataset grows, but performance can be quite impressive for small-to-medium datasets and low-dimensional features."

    "In this walkthrough, we covered how to combine deep neural networks with popular clustering algorithms to bring structure to unstructured data using scikit-learn and FiftyOne. Along the way, we saw that the feature vectors, the algorithm, and the hyperparameter you choose can greatly impact the final results of clustering computations, both in terms of what the clusters select for and how well they identify structure in your data.\n",

    "Once you have run these clustering routines on your data, a few key questions arise:\n",

    "1. How do I quantitatively compare and contrast these clustering runs?\n",

    "- **Choice of embedding model**: We used CLIP, a semantic foundation model for this walkthrough. See how things change when you use other semantic models from [Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers library](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/huggingface.html#image-embeddings), or [OpenCLIP](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/openclip.html). Now see how the picture changes when you use a ‚Äúpixels-and-patches‚Äù computer vision model like [ResNet50](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/model_zoo/models.html#resnet50-imagenet-torch), or a self‚Äìsupervised model like [DINOv2](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/model_zoo/models.html#dinov2-vitl14-torch).\n",
    "- **Clustering Hyperparameters**: We barely touched the number of clusters in this walkthrough. Your results may vary as you increase or decrease this number. For some techniques, like k-means clustering, there are heuristics you can use to [estimate the optimal number of clusters](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/k-mean-getting-the-optimal-number-of-clusters/). Don‚Äôt stop there; experiment with other hyperparameters as well!\n",
    "- **Concept Modeling Techniques**: the built-in concept modeling technique in this walkthrough uses GPT-4V and some light prompting to identify each cluster's core concept. This is but one way to approach an open-ended problem. Try using [image captioning](https://github.com/jacobmarks/image-captioning) and [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model), or create your own technique!"
