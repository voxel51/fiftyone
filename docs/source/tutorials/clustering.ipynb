But then, the next time you went to find a specific piece, you’d have quite the time digging around for it.\n",

Clustering algorithms take in a bunch of objects, and spit out assignments for each object. Unlike classification, however, clustering does not start with a list of classes to categorize the objects, forcing objects to fall into preset buckets. Rather, clustering attempts to *discover* the buckets given the data. In other words, clustering is about *uncovering* structure in data, not predicting labels in a preexisting structure."

    "**Centroid-based clustering**: for example, techniques like [K-means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means) and [Mean Shift](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#mean-shift) clustering. These methods try to find central points by which to define each cluster, called *centroids*, which seek to maximize some notion of coherence between points *within* a cluster. This flavor of clustering scales well to large datasets but is sensitive to outliers and random initialization. Often, multiple runs are performed, and the best one is chosen. You may find that techniques like K-means struggle with high-dimensional data — “the curse of dimensionality” — and can better uncover structure when paired with dimensionality reduction techniques like uniform manifold approximation & projection ([UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). We’ll explain how to pair the two below.\n",

Conceptually, these algorithms treat high-density regions as clusters, breaking the clusters off when the points become sufficiently spread out in feature space. Simple density-based techniques like DBSCAN can have difficulty working with high-dimensional data, where data may not be densely colocated. However, more sophisticated techniques like HDBSCAN can overcome some of these limitations and uncover remarkable structure from high dimensional features.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Construct clusters by starting with individual points and iteratively combining clusters into larger composites or \n",
    "2. Deconstruct clusters, starting with all objects in one cluster and iteratively diving clusters into smaller components.\n",

    "If you want to dive deeper into the world of clustering, here are a few avenues that you may want to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice of embedding model**: We used CLIP, a semantic foundation model for this walkthrough. See how things change when you use other semantic models from [Hugging Face’s Transformers library](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/huggingface.html#image-embeddings), or [OpenCLIP](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/openclip.html). Now see how the picture changes when you use a “pixels-and-patches” computer vision model like [ResNet50](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/model_zoo/models.html#resnet50-imagenet-torch), or a self–supervised model like [DINOv2](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/model_zoo/models.html#dinov2-vitl14-torch).\n",
    "- **Clustering Hyperparameters**: We barely touched the number of clusters in this walkthrough. Your results may vary as you increase or decrease this number. For some techniques, like k-means clustering, there are heuristics you can use to [estimate the optimal number of clusters](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/k-mean-getting-the-optimal-number-of-clusters/). Don’t stop there; experiment with other hyperparameters as well!\n",
    "- **Concept Modeling Techniques**: the built-in concept modeling technique in this walkthrough uses GPT-4V and some light prompting to identify each cluster's core concept. This is but one way to approach an open-ended problem. Try using [image captioning](https://github.com/jacobmarks/image-captioning) and [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model), or create your own technique!"
