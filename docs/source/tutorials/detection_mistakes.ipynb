    "# Finding Detection Mistakes with FiftyOne\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations mistakes create an artificial ceiling on the performance of your models. However, finding these mistakes by hand is at least as arduous as the original annotation work! Enter FiftyOne.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explore how FiftyOne can be used to help you find mistakes in your object detection annotations. To detect mistakes in classification datasets, check out [this tutorial](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/tutorials/classification_mistakes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading your existing dataset [into FiftyOne](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/import_datasets.html)\n",
    "- [Adding model predictions](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/recipes/adding_detections.html) to your dataset\n",
    "- Computing insights into your dataset relating to [possible label mistakes](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#label-mistakes)\n",
    "- Visualizing mistakes in the [FiftyOne App](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/app.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what's the takeaway?**\n",
    "\n",
    "FiftyOne can help you find and correct label mistakes in your datasets, enabling you to curate higher quality datasets and, ultimately, train better models!"
