    "# Detecting Subtle Anomalies in Agricultural Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world agricultural imagery presents unique challenges for anomaly detection. Leaves in orchards and plantations are captured under **uncontrolled environmental conditions** — changing illumination, variable backgrounds, and differences in distance or orientation. In addition, **image sizes and resolutions vary widely**, adding further complexity to building consistent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore these challenges using the **RoCoLe dataset**, which contains images of coffee leaves under both healthy and diseased conditions. Many of these samples appear *visually similar*, even across classes, making it difficult to spot small-scale or early-stage anomalies. At the end of the notebook we will explore a tiled dataset and compare that approach for anomaly detection in agriculture. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore and curate** the original dataset with [FiftyOne](https://voxel51.com/fiftyone/), identifying a critical subset of visually similar healthy vs. unhealthy samples.  \n",
    "2. **Investigate anomaly detection** approaches when differences are subtle and localized.  \n",
    "3. **Compare two data preparation strategies:**\n",
    "   - **Masking the leaf region** — isolating the target area to suppress background noise.  \n",
    "   - **Tiling the patches** — splitting images into small, consistent crops to amplify local anomalies.  \n",
    "4. **Train and evaluate** a *PaDiM* model under both strategies, analyzing how masking and tiling affect anomaly localization and detection performance.\n",

    "## Running PaDiM Inference and Writing Results to FiftyOne\n",
    "\n",
    "This function defines a complete inference pipeline that integrates **Anomalib’s PaDiM model** with **FiftyOne datasets**.  \n",
    "It handles model loading, prediction, tensor-to-array conversion, and structured field writing — all in a single, reusable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function, `run_inference()`, performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Resolution**\n",
    "   - Dynamically imports the correct `Padim` class across multiple Anomalib versions.\n",
    "   - Loads the trained model from a specified checkpoint (`.ckpt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Per-sample Inference**\n",
    "   - Iterates through all samples in a FiftyOne dataset or view (`sample_collection`).\n",
    "   - Runs inference on each image using `engine.predict()`.\n",
    "   - Collects both scalar and spatial predictions from Anomalib:\n",
    "     - `pred_score`: anomaly confidence score.  \n",
    "     - `pred_label`: binary anomaly flag (0 = normal, 1 = anomaly).  \n",
    "     - `anomaly_map`: pixel-wise heatmap showing anomalous intensity.  \n",
    "     - `pred_mask`: optional segmentation mask for localized defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Field Writing**\n",
    "   - Saves the following fields to each FiftyOne sample:\n",
    "     - `pred_anomaly_score_<key>` → anomaly confidence (float).  \n",
    "     - `pred_anomaly_<key>` → classification label (“normal” or “anomaly”).  \n",
    "     - `pred_anomaly_map_<key>` → spatial heatmap (as `fo.Heatmap`).  \n",
    "     - `pred_defect_mask_<key>` → segmentation mask (as `fo.Segmentation`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Helper Utilities**\n",
    "   - `_resolve_padim_cls()` ensures compatibility with all Anomalib versions.  \n",
    "   - `_to_numpy2d()` converts tensors and nested dataclasses to clean 2D NumPy arrays.  \n",
    "   - `_to_float()` safely converts torch scalars to Python floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",

    "## Inspecting PaDiM Predictions on a Single Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running batch-level evaluation, it’s useful to explore the output of the **PaDiM model** on an individual patch.  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Understand the model outputs**\n",
    "   - `pred_score`: Anomaly confidence score — higher values indicate greater deviation from normality.  \n",

    "To reduce **background false positives** and only count anomalies that fall **within the leaf**, this step:\n",
    "1. Builds a **full-image SAM2 leaf mask** from detections (`sam2_pred`).\n",
    "2. Resizes the **PaDiM defect mask** (`pred_defect_mask_padim`) to image size.\n",
    "3. Computes the **logical AND** between both masks to retain only defects **inside** the leaf area.\n",
    "4. Converts the overlap ratio into a **binary classification** (`normal` vs. `anormal`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "- `SAM_FIELD = \"sam2_pred\"` — SAM2 masks (detections with per-detection masks).  \n",
    "- `PADIM_FIELD = \"pred_defect_mask_padim\"` — PaDiM segmentation mask.  \n",

    "- `OUT_CLS_FIELD = \"pred_by_overlap\"` — output classification based on overlap.  \n",

    "- `OUT_DIR = \"/tmp/masks_and\"` — folder to export the AND masks as PNGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this cell does\n",
    "1. **Reconstructs SAM2 full-image mask**  \n",
    "   - Initializes an empty `H×W` boolean mask.  \n",
    "   - For each detection in `sam2_pred`, grabs `det.get_mask()` (which is relative to the detection’s bounding box), **resizes it** to the box size, and **pastes** it back into the full-image coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalizes PaDiM mask shape**  \n",
    "   - Reads the PaDiM mask, binarizes it, and **resizes** (nearest neighbor) to `(H, W)` if needed to match image size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combines masks & saves output**  \n",
    "   - Computes `and_mask = sam_mask & padim_mask`.  \n",
    "   - Saves `and_mask` via `fo.Segmentation(...).export_mask()` to `OUT_DIR`.  \n",
    "   - Stores the segmentation in `mask_and_sam2_padim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computes coverage & classifies**  \n",
    "   - `coverage = intersection(and_mask) / area(padim_mask)` (if PaDiM area > 0).  \n",
    "   - If `coverage >= 0.80` → `anormal`, else `normal`.  \n",
    "   - Writes a `Classification(label, confidence=coverage)` into `pred_by_overlap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this helps\n",
    "- Ensures anomalies are only counted **within the leaf** region predicted by SAM2.  \n",
    "- Drops spurious detections on **background** or **borders**, improving precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes & caveats\n",
    "- Use **nearest-neighbor** resizing for binary masks (already set via `order=0`) to avoid soft edges.  \n",
    "- If SAM2 misses parts of the leaf, coverage may be underestimated (potential false negatives).  \n",
    "- If PaDiM area is tiny/noisy, a high threshold (0.80) can be strict; consider tuning per dataset.  \n",
