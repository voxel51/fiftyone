    "Broadly speaking, [data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation) is any process that involves increasing the size of the training set by modifying the original data. Typically, data augmentation is used to fill expected gaps in the original data and reduce overfitting to the specific data that you were able to collect and curate. It is also a [handy technique for mitigating class imbalance](https://www.picsellia.com/post/improve-imbalanced-datasets-in-computer-vision): by augmenting the number of samples for underrepresented classes, you can restore balance to the training distribution. Often, augmentations can account for 90% of the training data, or even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of computer vision, modifications can be made via geometric transformations like rotations and reflections, transformations which blur or add noise, or transformations that simulate different lighting conditions, such as changing the brightness, contrast, or saturation. For most of these augmentations, if you just need to transform the raw images, then torchvision’s `transforms` module is a great solution. If you want to take your labels (bounding boxes, masks, and keypoints) along for the ride, then you’ll need a purpose-built image augmentation library, such as [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/), [imgaug](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [Augmentor](https://augmentor.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also more sophisticated image augmentation techniques for changing the scenery, background, and weather conditions in images. If you’re interested in this level of control over your augmentations, check out [Kopikat](https://www.kopikat.co/) and Stability AI’s [Sky Replacer](https://clipdrop.co/real-estate/sky-replacer).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While data augmentation itself does not include completely synthetic data generation, augmentation is often used in conjunction with synthetic data generation approaches. Synthetic data from [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) can be [orders of magnitude cheaper](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data/) than collecting similar data in the field — combining this with (computationally inexpensive) data augmentation can lead to still further cost savings!"

    "When applied irresponsibly, data augmentations can degrade model performance and have severe real–world consequences. Some transformations clearly push beyond the bounds of the desired data distribution — too much blurring makes an image unrecognizable; vertically flipping a portrait (leading to an upside down face) is clearly undesirable for most use cases.\n",

If you use this to train your model, the model might incorrectly tag [blue-and-gold macaws](https://animalia.bio/blue-and-gold-macaw) — which are far more abundant ([more than 10,000 in the wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-and-yellow_macaw#:~:text=The%20species%20is%20therefore%20listed,CITES%20Appendix%20II%2C%20trade%20restricted.)), share an overlapping geographic range and apart from their head look pretty similar.

    "To hammer this idea  home, let’s look at another example. Suppose you’re building a model to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. Typically, pneumonia shows up in these images as an abnormally opaque region within the chest, so teaching a neural net to diagnose it should be possible, but you only have hundreds of images — far too few to train your desired model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the augmentations you are interested in performing is changing the contrast in the images. Each lab from which you are receiving data sends you X-ray images with different amounts of contrast, so it seems reasonable to turn each image into a set of images across the spectrum of contrast. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there’s a problem here too. Turning the contrast up or down may be viable for some images. However, too high of a contrast can also change the perceived diagnosis. Consider the image on the left side below, of a non-pneumatic patient from the [ChestX-ray14 dataset](https://try.fiftyone.ai/datasets/chestx-ray14/samples). Now look at the image on the right, after the contrast has been increased and a region made substantially more opaque. If we retained the training label from the left, we would be telling the model that images like this are non-pneumatic. This could potentially cause confusion and result in false negative diagnoses."
