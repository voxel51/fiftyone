Data Lens
=========

.. default-role:: code

**Available in FiftyOne Enterprise v2.2+**

Data Lens is a feature built into the :ref:`FiftyOne Enterprise App <enterprise-app>`
which allows you to use FiftyOne to explore and import samples from external
data sources.

Whether your data resides in a database like PostgreSQL or a data lake like
:ref:`Databricks <data-lens-databricks>` or
:ref:`BigQuery <data-lens-bigquery>`, Data Lens provides a way to search your
data sources, visualize sample data, and import into FiftyOne for further
analysis.

How it works
____________

1. **Define your search experience**
    Tailor the interactions with your data source to exactly what you need.
    Data Lens provides a flexible framework which allows for extensive
    customization, allowing you to hone in on the questions that are most
    critical to your workflow. See
    :ref:`Integrating with Data Lens <data-lens-integration>` to learn more.

2. **Connect your data source**
    Provide configuration to Data Lens to connect to your data source. Once
    connected, you can start searching for samples directly from FiftyOne.
    See :ref:`Connecting a data source <data-lens-connecting-a-data-source>`
    to learn more.

3. **Interact with your data**
    View your samples using Data Lens' rich preview capabilities. Refine your
    search criteria to find samples of interest, then import your samples
    into a FiftyOne dataset for further analysis. See
    :ref:`Exploring samples <data-lens-querying-data>` to learn more.

.. _data-lens-connecting-a-data-source:

Connecting a data source
------------------------

A data source represents anywhere that you store your data outside of FiftyOne.
This could be a local SQL database, a hosted data lake, or an internal data
platform. To connect to your data source, you'll first implement a simple
operator which FiftyOne can use to communicate with your data source.

Once your operator is defined, you can navigate to the "Data sources" tab by
clicking on the tab header or by clicking on "Connect to a data source" from
the "Home" tab.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_data_sources_empty.png
    :alt: data-lens-data-sources-empty
    :align: center

Add a new data source by clicking on "Add data source".

Enter a useful name for your data source and provide the URI for your operator.
The URI should have the format `<your-plugin-name>/<your-operator-name>`.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_add_data_source.png
    :alt: data-lens-add-data-source
    :align: center

Click "Connect" once you're finished to save your configuration.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_data_sources.png
    :alt: data-lens-data-sources
    :align: center

If you need to update your Data Lens configuration, simply click the action
menu icon and select "Edit". Similarly, you can delete a Data Lens
configuration by clicking the action menu icon and selecting "Delete".

That's it. Now you're ready to explore your data source. You can head over to
the "Query data" tab and start interacting with your data.

.. note::

    Don't have a Data Lens operator yet? When you're ready to get started, you
    can follow our detailed :ref:`integration guide <data-lens-integration>`.

.. _data-lens-querying-data:

Exploring samples
-----------------

Once you've connected to a data source, you can open the "Query data" tab to
start working with your data.

In this tab, you can select from your connected data sources using the
"Select a data source" dropdown.

Below this dropdown, you can parameterize your search using the available
query parameters. These parameters are unique to each connected data source,
allowing you to tailor your search experience to exactly what you need.
Selecting a new data source will automatically update the query parameters to
match those expected by your data source.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_query.png
    :alt: data-lens-query
    :align: center

After you enter your query parameters, you can click the "Preview data" button
at the bottom of the page to fetch samples which match your query parameters.
These samples will be displayed in the preview panel, along with any features
associated with the sample like labels or bounding boxes.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_preview.png
    :alt: data-lens-preview
    :align: center

You can use the zoom slider to control the size of the samples, and you can
modify the number of preview samples shown by changing the "Number of preview
samples" input value and clicking "Preview data" again.

If you want to change your search, simply reopen the query parameters panel
and modify your inputs. Clicking "Preview data" will fetch new samples matching
the current query parameters.

If you want to import your samples into FiftyOne for further analysis, you can
import your samples to a dataset.

.. _data-lens-importing-to-fiftyone:

Importing samples to FiftyOne
-----------------------------

After generating a preview in Data Lens, you can click on the "Import data"
button to open the import dialog.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_import_dialog.png
    :alt: data-lens-import-dialog
    :align: center

Imports can be limited to a specific number of samples, or you can import all
samples matching your query parameters.

The "Skip existing samples" checkbox allows you to configure the behavior for
merging samples into a dataset. If checked, samples with a `filepath` which is
already present in the dataset will be skipped. If left unchecked, all samples
will be added to the dataset.

.. note::

    If you elect to skip existing samples, this will also deduplicate samples
    within the data being imported.

After configuring the size/behavior of your import, select a destination
dataset for the samples. This can be an existing dataset, or you can choose to
create a new dataset.

You can optionally specify tags to append to the `tags` field of each imported
sample.

When you click import, you will have the option to either execute immediately
or to schedule this import for asynchronous execution.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_import_options.png
    :alt: data-lens-import-options
    :align: center

If you are importing a small number of samples, then immediate execution may
be appropriate. However, for most cases it is recommended to schedule the
import, as this will result in more consistent and performant execution.

.. note::

    Scheduled imports use the
    :ref:`delegated operations <enterprise-delegated-operations>` framework to
    execute asynchronously on your connected compute cluster!

After selecting your execution preference, you will be able to monitor the
status of your import through the information provided by the import panel.

In the case of immediate execution, you will be presented with an option to
view your samples once the import is complete. Clicking on this button will
open your destination dataset containing your imported samples.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_immediate_import.png
    :alt: data-lens-immediate-import
    :align: center

In the case of scheduled execution, you will be presented with an option to
visit the :ref:`Runs page <enterprise-runs-page>`.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_scheduled_import.png
    :alt: data-lens-scheduled-import
    :align: center

From the Runs page, you can track the status of your import.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_runs_page.png
    :alt: data-lens-runs-page
    :align: center

Once your samples are imported, you will be able to leverage the full
capabilities of FiftyOne to analyze and curate your data, and you can continue
to use Data Lens to augment your datasets.

.. _data-lens-integration:

Integrating with Data Lens
__________________________

Data Lens makes use of FiftyOne's powerful
:ref:`plugins framework <fiftyone-plugins>` to allow you to tailor your
experience to meet the needs of your data. As part of the plugin framework,
you are able to create custom :ref:`operators <plugins-design-operators>`,
which are self-contained Python classes that provide custom functionality to
FiftyOne.

Data Lens defines an operator interface which makes it easy to connect to your
data sources. We'll walk through an example of creating your first Data Lens
operator.

.. _data-lens-setup:

Setting up your operator
------------------------

To assist with Data Lens integration, we can use the
:class:`DataLensOperator <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.operator.DataLensOperator>`
base class provided with the Enterprise SDK. This base class handles the
implementation for the operator's `execute()` method, and defines a single
abstract method that we'll implement.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # my_plugin/__init__.py
    from typing import Generator

    import fiftyone.operators as foo
    from fiftyone.operators.data_lens import (
        DataLensOperator,
        DataLensSearchRequest,
        DataLensSearchResponse
    )


    class MyCustomDataLensOperator(DataLensOperator):
        """Custom operator which integrates with Data Lens."""

        @property
        def config(self) -> foo.OperatorConfig:
            return foo.OperatorConfig(
                name="my_custom_data_lens_operator",
                label="My custom Data Lens operator",
                unlisted=True,
                execute_as_generator=True,
            )

        def handle_lens_search_request(
            self,
            request: DataLensSearchRequest,
            ctx: foo.ExecutionContext
        ) -> Generator[DataLensSearchResponse, None, None]
            # We'll implement our logic here
            pass

Let's take a look at what we have so far.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    class MyCustomDataLensOperator(DataLensOperator):

Our operator extends the
:class:`DataLensOperator <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.operator.DataLensOperator>`
provided by the Enterprise SDK. This base class defines the abstract
:meth:`handle_lens_search_request() <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.operator.DataLensOperator.handle_lens_search_request>`
method, which we will need to implement.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    @property
    def config(self) -> foo.OperatorConfig:
        return foo.OperatorConfig(
            # This is the name of your operator. FiftyOne will canonically
            # refer to your operator as <your-plugin>/<your-operator>.
            name="my_custom_data_lens_operator",

            # This is a human-friendly label for your operator.
            label="My custom Data Lens operator",

            # Setting unlisted to True prevents your operator from appearing
            # in lists of general-purpose operators, as this operator is not
            # intended to be directly executed.
            unlisted=True,

            # For compatibility with the DataLensOperator base class, we
            # instruct FiftyOne to execute our operator as a generator.
            execute_as_generator=True,
        )

The :meth:`config <fiftyone.operators.operator.Operator.config>` property
is part of the standard :ref:`operator interface <operator-interface>` and
provides configuration options for your operator.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def handle_lens_search_request(
        self,
        request: DataLensSearchRequest,
        ctx: foo.ExecutionContext
    ) -> Generator[DataLensSearchResponse, None, None]
        pass

The
:meth:`handle_lens_search_request() <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.operator.DataLensOperator.handle_lens_search_request>`
method provides us with two arguments: a
:class:`DataLensSearchRequest <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.models.DataLensSearchRequest>`
instance, and the current operator execution context.

The
:class:`DataLensSearchRequest <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.models.DataLensSearchRequest>`
is generated by the Data Lens framework and provides information about the
Data Lens user's query. The request object has
the following properties:

-   `request.search_params`: a dict containing the search parameters provided
    by the Data Lens user.
-   `request.batch_size`: a number indicating the maximum number of samples to
    return in a single batch.
-   `request.max_results`: a number indicating the maximum number of
    samples to return across all batches.

.. note::

    The Data Lens framework will automatically truncate responses to adhere
    to `request.max_results`. Any sample data beyond this limit will be
    discarded.

The `ctx` argument provides access to a
:ref:`range of useful capabilities <operator-execution-context>` which you can
leverage in your operator, including things like
:ref:`providing secrets to your operator <enterprise-secrets>`.

Using these inputs, we are expected to return a generator which yields
:class:`DataLensSearchResponse <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.models.DataLensSearchResponse>`
objects. To start, we'll create some synthetic data to better understand the
interaction between Data Lens and our operator. We'll look at a
:ref:`more realistic example <data-lens-databricks>` later on.

.. note::

    Why a generator? Generators provide a convenient approach for long-lived,
    lazy-fetching connections that are common in databases and data lakes.
    While Data Lens does support operators which do not execute as generators,
    we recommend using a generator for ease of integration.

.. _data-lens-generating-responses:

Generating search responses
---------------------------

To adhere to the Data Lens interface, we need to yield
:class:`DataLensSearchResponse <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.models.DataLensSearchResponse>`
objects from our operator. A
:class:`DataLensSearchResponse <fiftyone.operators.data_lens.models.DataLensSearchResponse>`
is comprised of the following fields:

-   `response.result_count`: a number indicating the number of samples being
    returned in this response.
-   `response.query_result`: a list of dicts containing serialized
    :class:`Sample <fiftyone.core.sample.Sample>` data, e.g. obtained via
    :meth:`to_dict() <fiftyone.core.sample.Sample.to_dict>`.

.. note::

    Data Lens expects sample data to adhere to the
    :class:`Sample <fiftyone.core.sample.Sample>` format, which is easy to
    achieve by using the FiftyOne SDK to create your sample data, as shown
    below.

To see how Data Lens works, let's yield a response with a single synthetic
sample.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def handle_lens_search_request(
        self,
        request: DataLensSearchRequest,
        ctx: foo.ExecutionContext
    ) -> Generator[DataLensSearchResponse, None, None]
        # We'll use a placeholder image for our synthetic data
        image_url = "https://placehold.co/150x150"

        # Create a sample using the SDK
        synthetic_sample = fo.Sample(filepath=image_url)

        # Convert our samples to dicts
        samples = [synthetic_sample.to_dict()]

        # We'll ignore any inputs for now and yield a single response
        yield DataLensSearchResponse(
            result_count=len(samples),
            query_result=samples
        )

Let's see what this looks like in Data Lens.

After adding the operator as a data source, we can navigate to the "Query data"
tab to interact with the operator. When we click the preview button, the Data
Lens framework invokes our operator to retrieve sample data. Our operator
yields a single sample, and we see that sample shown in the preview.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_synthetic_sample.png
    :alt: data-lens-synthetic-sample
    :align: center

Let's modify our operator to incorporate the `request.batch_size` property.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def handle_lens_search_request(
        self,
        request: DataLensSearchRequest,
        ctx: foo.ExecutionContext
    ) -> Generator[DataLensSearchResponse, None, None]
        samples = []

        # Generate number of samples equal to request.batch_size
        for i in range(request.batch_size):
            samples.append(
                fo.Sample(
                    # We'll modify our synthetic data to include the
                    # sample's index as the image text.
                    filepath=f"https://placehold.co/150x150?text={i + 1}"
                ).to_dict()
            )

        # Still yielding a single response
        yield DataLensSearchResponse(
            result_count=len(samples),
            query_result=samples
        )

Now if we re-run our preview, we see that we get a number of samples equal to
the "Number of preview samples" input.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_synthetic_batch.png
    :alt: data-lens-synthetic-batch
    :align: center

If we modify that number and regenerate the preview, we can see that the number
of samples remains in sync. For preview functionality, Data Lens fetches
sample data in a single batch, so we can expect these values to be the same.

.. _data-lens-working-with-user-data:

Working with user-provided data
-------------------------------

Let's now look at how Data Lens users are able to interact with our operator.
Data Lens is designed to enable users to quickly explore samples of interest,
and a key component is providing users a way to control the behavior of our
operator.

To achieve this, we simply need to define the possible inputs to our operator
in the
:meth:`resolve_input() <fiftyone.operators.operator.Operator.resolve_input>`
method.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def resolve_input(self):
        # We define our inputs as an object.
        # We'll add specific fields to this object which represent a single input.
        inputs = types.Object()

        # Add a string field named "sample_text"
        inputs.str("sample_text", label="Sample text", description="Text to render in samples")

        return types.Property(inputs)

.. note::

    For more information on operator inputs, see
    :ref:`the plugin documentation <operator-inputs>`.

With this method implemented, Data Lens will construct a form allowing users
to define any or all of these inputs.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_synthetic_query.png
    :alt: data-lens-synthetic-query
    :align: center

We can then use this data to change the behavior of our operator. Let's add
logic to integrate `sample_text` into our operator.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def handle_lens_search_request(
        self,
        request: DataLensSearchRequest,
        ctx: foo.ExecutionContext
    ) -> Generator[DataLensSearchResponse, None, None]
        # Retrieve our "sample_text" input from request.search_params.
        # These parameter names should match those used in resolve_input().
        sample_text = request.search_params.get("sample_text", "")

        samples = []

        # Create a sample for each character in our input text
        for char in sample_text:
            samples.append(
                fo.Sample(
                    filepath=f"https://placehold.co/150x150?text={char}"
                ).to_dict()
            )

            # Yield batches when we have enough samples
            if len(samples) == request.batch_size:
                yield DataLensSearchResponse(
                    result_count=len(samples),
                    query_result=samples
                )

                # Reset our batch
                samples = []

        # We've generated all our samples, but might be in the middle of a batch
        if len(samples) > 0:
            yield DataLensSearchResponse(
                result_count=len(samples),
                query_result=samples
            )

        # Now we're done :)

Now when we run our preview, we can see that the text we provide as input is
reflected in the samples returned by our operator. Modifying the text and
regenerating the preview yields the expected result.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/data_lens_synthetic_text.png
    :alt: data-lens-synthetic-text
    :align: center

There are a couple things to note about the changes we made here.

-   Inputs can be specified with `required=True`, in which case Data Lens will
    ensure that the user provides a value for that input. If an input is not
    explicitly required, then we should be sure to handle the case where it is
    not present.
-   In most real scenarios, our operator will be processing more samples than
    fit in a single batch. (This is even true here, where there is no upper
    bound on our input length). As such, our operator should respect the
    `request.batch_size` parameter and yield batches of samples as they are
    available.

.. note::

    This example is meant to illustrate how users can interact with our
    operator. For a more realistic view into how inputs can tailor our search
    experience, see our example
    :ref:`integration with Databricks <data-lens-databricks>`.

.. _data-lens-preview-vs-import:

Differences in preview and import
---------------------------------

While the examples here are focused on preview functionality, the Data Lens
framework invokes your operator in the same way to achieve both preview and
import functionality. The `request.batch_size` and `request.max_results`
parameters can be used to optimize your data retrieval, but preview and import
should otherwise be treated as functionally equivalent.

Let's take a look at a few parts in detail.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Create our client
    client = bigquery.Client()

In practice, you'll likely need to use :ref:`secrets <enterprise-secrets>` to
securely provide credentials to connect to your data source.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Retrieve our Data Lens search parameters
    detection_label = request.search_params.get("detection_label", "")

    # Construct our query
    query = """
            SELECT
                media_path, tags, detections, keypoints
            FROM `my_dataset.samples_json`,
            UNNEST(JSON_QUERY_ARRAY(detections)) as detection
            WHERE JSON_VALUE(detection.label) = @detection_label
        """

Here we're using our user-provided input parameters to tailor our query to only
the samples of interest. This logic can be as simple or complex as needed to
match our use case.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Wait for results
    rows = query_job.result(
        # BigQuery will handle pagination automatically, but
        # we can optimize its behavior by synchronizing with
        # the parameters provided by Data Lens
        page_size=request.batch_size,
        max_results=request.max_results
    )

Here we're using `request.batch_size` and `request.max_results` to help
BigQuery align its performance with our use case. In cases where
`request.max_results` is smaller than our universe of samples (such as during
preview or small imports), we can prevent fetching more data than we need,
improving both query performance and operational cost.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Transform sample data from BigQuery format to FiftyOne
    samples.append(self.convert_to_sample(row))

Here we are converting our sample data from its storage format to a FiftyOne
:class:`Sample <fiftyone.core.sample.Sample>`. This is where we'll add features
to our samples, such as :ref:`labels <using-labels>`.

As we can see from this example, we can make our Data Lens search experience
as powerful as it needs to be. We can leverage internal libraries and services,
hosted solutions, and tooling that meets the specific needs of our data. We
can expose flexible but precise controls to users to allow them to find exactly
the data that's needed.

Snippet: Dynamic user inputs
----------------------------

As the volume and complexity of your data grows, you may want to expose many
options to Data Lens users, but doing so all at once can be overwhelming for
the user. In this example, we'll look at how we can use
:ref:`dynamic operators <operator-inputs>` to conditionally expose
configuration options to Data Lens users.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    class MyOperator(DataLensOperator):
        @property
        def config(self) -> foo.OperatorConfig:
            return OperatorConfig(
                name="my_operator",
                label="My operator",
                dynamic=True,
            )


By setting `dynamic=True` in our operator config, our operator will be able to
customize the options shown to a Data Lens user based on the current state.
Let's use this to optionally show an "advanced options" section in our query
parameters.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def resolve_input(self, ctx: foo.ExecutionContext):
        inputs = types.Object()

        inputs.str("some_param", label="Parameter value")
        inputs.str("other_param", label="Other value")

        inputs.bool("show_advanced", label="Show advanced options", default=False)

        # Since this is a dynamic operator,
        #   we can use `ctx.params` to conditionally show options
        if ctx.params.get("show_advanced") is True:
            # In this example, we'll optionally show configuration which allows a user
            #   to remap selected sample fields to another name.
            # This could be used to enable users to import samples into datasets with
            #   varying schemas.
            remappable_fields = ("field_a", "field_b")
            for field_name in remappable_fields:
                inputs.str(f"{field_name}_remap", label=f"Remap {field_name} to another name")

        return types.Property(inputs)

Our operator's `resolve_input` method will be called each time `ctx.params`
changes, which allows us to create an experience that is tailored to the Data
Lens user's behavior. In this example, we're optionally displaying advanced
configuration that allows a user to remap sample fields. Applying this
remapping might look something like this.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def _remap_sample_fields(self, sample: dict, request: DataLensSearchRequest):
        remappable_fields = ("field_a", "field_b")
        for field_name in remappable_fields:
            remapped_field_name = request.search_params.get(f"{field_name}_remap")
            if remapped_field_name not in (None, ""):
                sample[remapped_field_name] = sample[field_name]
                del sample[field_name]

Of course, dynamic operators can be used for much more than this. Search
experiences can be broadened or narrowed to allow for both breadth and depth
within your connected data sources.

As an example, suppose a user is searching for detections of "traffic light"
in an autonomous driving dataset. A dynamic operator can be used to expose
additional search options that are specific to traffic lights, such as being
able to select samples with only red, yellow, or green lights. In this way,
dynamic operators provide a simple mechanism for developing intuitive and
context-sensitive search experiences for Data Lens users.
