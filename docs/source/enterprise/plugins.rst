FiftyOne Enterprise Plugins
===========================

.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne Enterprise provides native support for installing and running
:ref:`FiftyOne plugins <fiftyone-plugins>`, which offers powerful opportunities
to extend and customize the functionality of your Enterprise deployment to suit your
>>>>>>> develop
needs.

.. note::

    What can you do with plugins? Check out

    :ref:`delegated operations <enterprise-delegated-operations>` to see some quick
    examples, then check out the
    `FiftyOne plugins <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins>`_
    repository for a growing collection of prebuilt plugins that you can add to
    your Enterprise deployment!

.. _enterprise-plugins-page:

Plugins page
____________

Admins can use the plugins page to upload, manage, and configure permissions
for plugins that are made available to users of your Enterprise deployment.

Admins can access the plugins page under Settings > Plugins. It displays a
list of all installed plugins and their operators, as well as the enablement
and permissions of each.

.. _enterprise-plugins-install:

Installing a plugin
___________________

Admins can install plugins via the Enterprise UI or Management SDK.

.. note::

    A plugin is a directory (or ZIP of it) that contains a top-level
    ``fiftyone.yml`` file.

Enterprise UI
-------------

To install a plugin, click the "Install plugin" button on the plugins page.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/plugins_install_btn.png
   :alt: enterprise-plugins-page-install-button

Admins can also use the
:meth:`upload_plugin() <fiftyone.management.plugin.upload_plugin>` method from
the Management SDK:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    # You can pass the directory or an already zipped version of it
    fom.upload_plugin("/path/to/plugin_dir")

.. _enterprise-plugins-upgrade:

Upgrading a plugin
__________________

Admins can upgrade plugins at any time through the Enterprise UI or Management SDK.

methods from the management SDK:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    # Disable a plugin
    fom.set_plugin_enabled(plugin_name, False)

    # Disable a particular operator
    fom.set_plugin_operator_enabled(plugin_name, operator_name, False)

.. _enterprise-plugins-permissions:

Plugin permissions
__________________

Admins can optionally configure access to plugins and individual operators
within them via any combination of the permissions described below:

.. table::

    +-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Permission                    | Description                                                                |
    +===============================+============================================================================+
    | Minimum Role                  | The minimum role a user must have to execute the operation.                |
    +-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Minimum Dataset Permission    | The minimum dataset permission a user must have to perform the operation   |
    |                               | on a particular dataset.                                                   |
    +-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Admins can also use the
:meth:`set_plugin_operator_permissions() <fiftyone.management.plugin.set_plugin_operator_permissions>`
method from the Management SDK:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    # Set minimum role permission only
    fom.set_plugin_operator_enabled(
        plugin_name,
        operator_name,
        minimum_role=fom.MEMBER,
    )

    # Set minimum dataset permission only
    fom.set_plugin_operator_enabled(
        plugin_name,
        operator_name,
        minimum_dataset_permission=fom.EDIT,
    )

    # Set both minimum role and minimum dataset permissions
    fom.set_plugin_operator_enabled(
        plugin_name,
        operator_name,
        minimum_role=fom.EDIT,
        minimum_dataset_permission=fom.EDIT,
    )

Default permissions
-------------------

When new plugins are installed, any operators they contain are initialized with
the default permissions for your deployment.

By default, the initial permissions are:

.. table::

    +-------------------------------+---------------+
    | Permission                    | Default       |
    +===============================+===============+
    | Minimum Role                  | Member        |
    +-------------------------------+---------------+
    | Minimum Dataset Permission    | Edit          |
    +-------------------------------+---------------+

Enterprise UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default operator permissions can be configured by navigating to the page at
Settings > Security and looking under the Plugins header. Click the dropdown
for the permission you want to change and select the new value.

.. image:: /images/enterprise/plugins_org_settings.png

method from the Management SDK:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.management as fom

    fom.set_organization_settings(
        default_operator_minimum_role=fom.MEMBER,
        default_operator_minimum_dataset_permission=fom.EDIT,
    )

.. _enterprise-delegated-operations:

Delegated operations
____________________

:ref:`Delegated operations <delegated-operations>` are a powerful feature of
FiftyOne's plugin framework that allows users to schedule tasks from within the
App that are executed in the background on a connected compute cluster.

With FiftyOne Enterprise, your team can
:ref:`upload and permission <enterprise-plugins-page>` custom operations that your
users can execute from the Enterprise App, all of which run against a central
orchestrator :ref:`configured by <enterprise-delegated-orchestrator>` your admins.

Why is this awesome? Your AI stack needs a flexible data-centric component that
enables you to organize and compute on your data. With delegated operations,
FiftyOne Enterprise becomes both a dataset management/visualization tool and a
workflow automation tool that defines how your data-centric workflows like
ingestion, curation, and evaluation are performed. In short, think of FiftyOne
Enterprise as the single source of truth on which you co-develop your data and
models together.

What can delegated operations do for you? Get started by installing any of
these plugins available in the
`FiftyOne Plugins <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins>`_ repository:

For example, wish you could import data from within the App? With the
`@voxel51/io <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/io/README.md>`_,
plugin you can!

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/import.gif

Want to send data for annotation from within the App? Sure thing, just install the
`@voxel51/annotation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/annotation/README.md>`_
plugin:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/annotation.gif

Have model predictions on your dataset that you want to evaluate? The
`@voxel51/evaluation <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/evaluation/README.md>`_
plugin makes it easy:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/evaluation.gif

Need to compute embedding for your dataset so you can visualize them in the
:ref:`Embeddings panel <app-embeddings-panel>`? Kick off the task with the
`@voxel51/brain <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/blob/main/plugins/brain/README.md>`_
plugin and proceed with other work while the execution happens in the background:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/examples/embeddings.gif

When you choose delegated execution in the App, these tasks are automatically
scheduled for execution on your
:ref:`connected orchestrator <enterprise-delegated-orchestrator>` and you can
continue with other work. Meanwhile, all datasets have a
:ref:`Runs tab <enterprise-managing-delegated-operations>` in the App where you can
browse a history of all delegated operations that have been run on the dataset
and their status.

.. _enterprise-delegated-orchestrator:

Configuring your orchestrator(s)
________________________________

FiftyOne Enterprise offers a builtin orchestrator that is configured as part of your
team's deployment with a default level of compute capacity.

It is also possible to connect your FiftyOne Enterprise deployment to an externally
managed workflow orchestration tool (`Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org>`_,
`Flyte <https://flyte.org>`_,
`Spark <https://www.databricks.com/product/spark>`_, etc).

.. note::

    Contact your Voxel51 support team to scale your deployment's compute
    capacity or if you'd like to use an external orchestrator.

.. _enterprise-managing-delegated-operations:

Managing delegated operations
_____________________________

Every dataset in FiftyOne Enterprise has a Runs page that allows users with access
to monitor and explore delegated operations scheduled against that dataset.

All scheduled operations are maintained in a queue and will be automatically
executed as resources are available on the targeted orchestrator.

.. note::

    The Runs page only tracks operations that are **scheduled** for delegated
    execution, not operations that are executed immediately in the App.

.. _enterprise-runs-page:

Runs page
---------

The Runs page is accessible to all users with at least **Can View** access to a dataset.

You can access the Runs page by clicking on the "Runs" tab from the
:ref:`Samples toolbar <enterprise-using-datasets>` under your dataset name.

Once you are on the Runs page, you will see a table with the list of all operators scheduled for execution.
As an admin, you can see any scheduled or running operations by any user of your organization on any dataset.
While as an organization member with less than admin privileges, you can view your own operations, for only
datasets you have access to. You can sort, search, and filter runs shown to refine the list as you like:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_general.png

.. _enterprise-runs-statuses:

Statuses
^^^^^^^
For any run in the Runs page, there are 5 potential statuses:

- **Scheduled**: The run has been scheduled for execution but has not yet started.
- **Queued**: The run is waiting for resources to become available on the orchestrator.
- **Running**: The run is currently being executed.
- **Completed**: The run has completed successfully.
- **Failed**: The run failed to complete.

All runs begin in the Scheduled state and move to the Queued state if a position is open in the execution queue.
At most there can be three Queued runs at any given time. If there are more than three operations that have not
entered the execution queue, then they will remain in the Scheduled state until a spot in the execution queue opens up.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_statuses.png

.. note::

    Hovering over the status badge of a run in a Scheduled or Queued state will provide you with more information about its execution.
    Most importantly, you can view the position of where in the Scheduled ordering your run is if there are multiple by hovering over the badge.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_hover_queued.png

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_hover_scheduled.png

.. _enterprise-runs-sorting:

Sorting
^^^^^^^

By default, the runs table is sorted by recency, the newest run to be added to the Runs page, but you can use the dropdown menu in the upper right
of the table to sort by other fields like: last updated, oldest, or the name of the operator.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_sorting.png

.. _enterprise-runs-filtering:

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^

You can also filter the runs table to see a subset of runs.

Depending on your permissions, you can toggle between “My Runs” and “All Runs” to see what runs you have scheduled versus runs that others in your organization have scheduled:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_my_vs_all.png

You can further refine the list of runs using the Status dropdown to select one or more statuses you would like to filter by:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_statuses.png

If you have admin privileges, you can also toggle a filter to show "All Datasets" or "This Dataset" which will show all runs for your organization versus only runs for the dataset you are currently viewing:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_this_vs_all.png

.. _enterprise-runs-searching:

Searching
^^^^^^^^^

You can also use the search functionality to filter the list of runs by
keyword. As you type your query in the search box, the list of runs will be
updated to show only the runs matching your query:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_search.png

.. note::

    Search is case-sensitive and you can currently only search by operator
    name, not label. For example, the search "bright" does not match against the label
    *compute_brightness* in the image above but instead the operator name *@voxel51/panels/compute_brightness*.

.. _enterprise-runs-re-running:

Re-running
^^^^^^^^^^

From the Runs page, you can trigger a re-run of any listed run by clicking the
three-dots to open the actions menu and then clicking "Re-run":

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_re_run.png

.. _enterprise-runs-pinning:

Pinning
^^^^^^^

Pinned runs are displayed to the right of the runs table. By default, five
pinned runs will be displayed. However, if there are more than five pinned
runs, you will see a button to expand the list.

To pin a run, hover over its row in the runs table and click the pin icon that
appears beside the operator label:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_pinning.png

.. note::

    Pinned runs are stored at the dataset-level and will be visible to all
    users with access to that dataset.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_pinned_sidebar.png

.. _enterprise-runs-renaming:

Renaming
^^^^^^^^

When delegating an operator multiple times on the same dataset, you may wish to
give the runs custom labels so that you can easily identify each run later.

To edit the label of an operator run, move your mouse cursor over the label of interest
and click the pencil button as indicated by “1” below. This will present an input field
indicated by “2” where you can update the label to the text of your choice. Once you are
ready to apply changes, click the save button indicated by “3”.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_rename.png

.. _enterprise-runs-mark-as-failed:

Mark as failed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a delegated operation run terminates unexpectedly without reporting failure,
you can manually mark it as failed from the Runs page.

To mark a run as failed, first the run must be in the Running state.
While the run is in the Running state, click the three dots indicated by "1". Then, in the
menu, click "Mark as failed" as indicated by "2". The run status will be
updated and will now display as failed.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_mark_as_failed.png

.. note::

    If the delegated operation is, in fact, still in progress in your
    orchestrator, marking the run as failed will **not** terminate the
    execution of operation. It will continue executiong until completion
    but the operation will be marked as failed regardless of its outcome.

.. _enterprise-runs-monitoring-progress:

Monitoring progress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delegated operations can optionally
:ref:`report their progress <operator-reporting-progress>` during execution.

If progress is available for a run, it will be displayed in the Runs table as indicated by “2”.
By default, the general status of a run and the progress of running operations is automatically refreshed.
You can disable the auto-refresh of running operations by toggling the auto-refresh setting indicated by “1”.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_runnning_basic.png

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/runs_progress_enabled.png

.. _enterprise-run-page:

Run page
--------

The Run page for a specific run allows you to see information about a specific run such as inputs,
outputs, and errors.

You can visit the Run page for a run by clicking on a run in the runs table, 
the Pinned runs, or the Recent runs widgets.

.. _enterprise-run-page-input:

Input
^^^^^

The Input tab on the Run page lets you see the input parameters that were
provided when the run was scheduled:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_input_general.png

**Raw input**

By default, a rendered version (similar to what is displayed when invoking an
operator) of input parameters is displayed. However, you can switch to raw view
by clicking the "Show raw" toggle button:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_input_raw.png

.. _enterprise-run-page-output:

Output
^^^^^^

The Output tab on the Run page lets you see the preview of the result of a
completed run:

.. note::

    The Output tab is only available for completed run.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_output.png

.. _enterprise-run-page-errors:

Errors
^^^^^^

The Errors tab on the Run page will appear if the run failed and it lets you 
see the errors that occurred:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_error.png

.. _enterprise-run-page-view:

View
^^^^

The View tab on the Run page lets you see the dataset view on which the run was
scheduled:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/run_view.png

.. _enterprise-run-page-logs:

Logs
^^^^

The Logs tab on the Run page allows you to view any logging associated with your run:

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/logs_general.png

**Logs setup**

Setting up logs happens at the deployment level. In order for logs to appear on your Runs page, 
you need to explicitly define log generation behavior in your FiftyOne Enterprise deployment when 
setting up Delegated Operations.

Here are the setup instructions for logging in the two deployment configurations we support: 
`Helm <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app-deploy/blob/main/helm/docs/configuring-delegated-operators.md>`_ & 
`Docker <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-teams-app-deploy/blob/main/docker/docs/configuring-delegated-operators.md>`_.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/logs_configure_not_setup.png

.. note::

    If you set up logs with a third-party orchestrator like Airflow, logs will **not** be natively available, 
    however, we will report the log location URI for the third-party path you defined in your FiftyOne Enterprise deployment.

**Logs availability**

If logs are set up, they will appear natively within the Logs tab after the completion of a run. 
Logs will not appear before completion. If log creation errors out for any reason, 
logs will not be available and a generalized message will be shown indicating such.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/logs_not_available_general.png

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/logs_not_available_pre_completion.png

**Logs structure**

If logs are available, they are displayed in a structured format. 
There will be 3 columns, and each row represents a singular line of a log file. 
The columns Timestamp, Severity, and Message define the log structure and will be shown natively in table format up to 1 MB in total content size.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/logs_general_with_columns.png

.. note::

    If the content size of logs for a given run exceeds 1 MB, no content will be shown and instead a Download Logs button will appear.
    Clicking this button will download the logs as a text file.

.. image:: /images/plugins/operators/runs/logs_too_large.png

**Download logs**
