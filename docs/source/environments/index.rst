FiftyOne Environments
=====================

.. default-role:: code

This guide describes best practices for using FiftyOne with data stored in
various environments, including local machines, remote servers, and cloud
storage.

Terminology
___________

- :ref:`Local machine <local-data>`: Data is stored on the same computer that
  will be used to launch the App

* :ref:`Remote machine <remote-data>`: Data is stored on disk on a separate
  machine (typically a remote server) from the one that will be used to launch
  the App

* :ref:`Notebooks <notebooks>`: You are working from a
  `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org>`_,
  `Google Colab Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com>`_, or
  `Databricks Notebook <https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/index.html>`_
  `SageMaker Notebook <https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/notebooks/>`_
   

* :ref:`Cloud storage <cloud-storage>`: Data is stored in a cloud bucket
  (e.g., :ref:`S3 <AWS>`, :ref:`GCS <google-cloud>`, or :ref:`Azure <azure>`)

.. _local-data:

Local data
__________

When working with data that is stored on disk on a machine with a display, you
can directly :ref:`load a dataset <loading-datasets>` and then
:ref:`launch the App <creating-an-app-session>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # On local machine
    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.Dataset("my-dataset")

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)  # (optional) port=XXXX

From here, you can explore the dataset interactively from the App and from your
Python shell by manipulating the
:class:`session object <fiftyone.core.session.Session>`.

.. note::

    You can use custom ports when launching the App in order to operate
    multiple App instances simultaneously on your machine.

.. _remote-data:

Remote data
___________

FiftyOne supports working with data that is stored on a remote machine that you
have `ssh` access to. The basic workflow is to load a dataset on the remote
machine via the FiftyOne Python library, launch a
:ref:`remote session <remote-session>`, and connect to the session on your
local machine where you can then interact with the App.

First, `ssh` into your remote machine and
:ref:`install FiftyOne <installing-fiftyone>` if necessary.

Then :ref:`load a dataset <loading-datasets>` using Python on the remote
machine and launch a remote session:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # On remote machine
    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.load_dataset(...)

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, remote=True)  # optional: port=XXXX

Leave the Python REPL running and follow the instructions for connecting to
this session remotely that were printed to your terminal (also described
below).

.. note::

    You can manipulate the `session` object on the remote machine as usual to
    programmatically interact with the App instance that you view locally.

To connect to your remote session, open a new terminal window on your local
machine and execute the following command to setup port forwarding to connect
to your remote session:

.. code-block:: shell

    # On local machine
    ssh -N -L 5151:127.0.0.1:XXXX [<username>@]<hostname>

Leave this process running and open http://localhost:5151 in your browser to
access the App.

In the above, `[<username>@]<hostname>` specifies the remote machine to connect
to, `XXXX` refers to the port that you chose when you launched the session on
your remote machine (the default is 5151), and `5151` specifies the local port
to use to connect to the App (and can be customized).

Alternatively, if you have FiftyOne installed on your local machine, you can
:ref:`use the CLI <cli-fiftyone-app-connect>` to automatically configure port
forwarding and open the App in your browser as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    # On local machine
    fiftyone app connect --destination [<username>@]<hostname>

If you choose a custom port `XXXX` on the remote machine, add a ``--port XXXX``
flag to the above command.

If you would like to use a custom local port, add a ``--local-port YYYY`` flag
to the above command.

.. note::

    You can customize the local/remote ports used when launching remote
    sessions in order to connect/service multiple remote sessions
    simultaneously.

.. note::

    If you use ssh keys to connect to your remote machine, you can use the
    optional `--ssh-key` argument of the
    :ref:`fiftyone app connect <cli-fiftyone-app-connect>` command.

    However, if you are using this key regularly,
    `it is recommended <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/494485>`_ to add it
    to your `~/.ssh/config` as the default `IdentityFile`.

.. _restricting-app-address:

Restricting the App address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the App will listen on `localhost`. However, you can provide the
optional `address` parameter to
:meth:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>` to specify a particular
IP address or hostname for the App to listen on.

Using the default of `localhost` means the App can only be accessed from the
local machine or a machine that was able to setup ssh port forwarding as
described in the previous section.

An alternative is to set the App address to `"0.0.0.0"` so that the App can be
accessed from a remote host or from the local machine itself.  Using `"0.0.0.0"`
will bind the App to all available interfaces and will allow access to the App
from any remote resource with access to your network.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.load_dataset(...)

    # Enable connections from remote hosts
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, remote=True, address="0.0.0.0")

If desired, you can permanently configure an App address by setting the
`default_app_address` of your :ref:`FiftyOne config <configuring-fiftyone>`.
You can achieve this by adding the following entry to your
`~/.fiftyone/config.json` file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "default_app_address": "0.0.0.0"
    }

or by setting the following environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export FIFTYONE_DEFAULT_APP_ADDRESS='0.0.0.0'

.. _notebooks:

Notebooks
_________

FiftyOne officially supports `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_,
`Google Colab Notebooks <https://colab.research.google.com>`_,
`Databricks Notebooks <https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/index.html>`_.
App support is also available in
`SageMaker Notebooks <https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/notebooks/>`_ and any
cloud notebook that has an accessible network proxy via configured
:ref:`proxy_url <configuring-proxy-url>`.

To use FiftyOne in a notebook, simply install `fiftyone` via `pip`:

.. code-block:: text

    !pip install fiftyone

and load datasets as usual. When you run
:meth:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>` in a notebook, an App
window will be opened in the output of your current cell.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.Dataset("my-dataset")

    # Creates a session and opens the App in the output of the cell
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

Any time you update the state of your ``session`` object; e.g., by setting
:meth:`session.dataset <fiftyone.core.session.Session.dataset>` or
:meth:`session.view <fiftyone.core.session.Session.view>`, a new App window
will be automatically opened in the output of the current cell. The previously
active App will be "frozen", i.e., replaced with a screenshot of its current
state.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # A new App window will be created in the output of this cell, and the
    # previously active App instance will be replaced with a screenshot
    session.view = dataset.take(10)

You can reactivate a frozen App instance from the same notebook session by
clicking on the screenshot.

.. note::

    Reactivating a frozen App instance will load the current state of the
    ``session`` object, not the state in which the screenshot was taken.

To reactivate an App instance from a previous session, e.g., when running a
notebook downloaded from the web for the first time, you must (re)run the cell.

You can manually replace the active App instance with a screenshot by calling
:meth:`session.freeze() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.freeze>`. This is
useful when you are finished with your notebook and ready to share it with
others, as an active App instance itself cannot be viewed outside of the
current notebook session.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Replace active App instance with screenshot so App state is viewable offline
    session.freeze()

Manually controlling App instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to manually control when new App instances are created in a
notebook, you can pass the ``auto=False`` flag to
:meth:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Creates a session but does not open an App instance
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, auto=False)

When ``auto=False`` is provided, a new App window is created only when you call
:meth:`session.show() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.show>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Update the session's view; no App window is created
    session.view = dataset.take(10)

    # In another cell

    # Now open an App window in the cell's output
    session.show()

As usual, this App window will remain connected to your ``session`` object, so
it will stay in-sync with your session whenever it is active.

.. note::

    If you run :meth:`session.show() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.show>` in
    multiple cells, only the most recently created App window will be active,
    i.e., synced with the ``session`` object.

    You can reactivate an older cell by clicking the link in the deactivated
    App window, or by running the cell again. This will deactivate the
    previously active cell.

.. _opening-app-dedicated-tab:

Opening the App in a dedicated tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are working from a Jupyter notebook, you can open the App in a separate
browser tab rather than working with it in cell output(s).

To do this, pass the ``auto=False`` flag to
:meth:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>` when you launch the
App (so that additional App instances will not be created as you work) and then
call :meth:`session.open_tab() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.open_tab>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Launch the App in a dedicated browser tab
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, auto=False)
    session.open_tab()

.. _remote-notebooks:

Remote notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also work in a Jupyter notebook in your local browser that is
`served from a remote machine <https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook>`_
where your data is located. Follow the instructions below to achieve this.

**On the remote machine:**

Start the Jupyter server on a port of your choice:

.. code:: shell

    # On remote machine
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=XXXX /path/to/notebook.ipynb

**On your local machine:**

Back on your local machine, you will need to forward the remote port `XXXX` to
a local port (we'll also use `XXXX` here, for consistency):

.. code:: shell

    # On local machine
    ssh -N -L XXXX:localhost:XXXX [<username>@]<hostname>

Now open ``localhost:XXXX`` in your browser and you should find your notebook!

If your notebook launches the :ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>`, you will also
need to forward the port used by the App to your local machine. By default,
the App uses port `5151`, but you can :ref:`specify any port <remote-data>`,
say `YYYY`, not currently in use on your remote machine:

.. code:: shell

    # On local machine
    ssh -N -L 5151:localhost:YYYY [<username>@]<hostname>

**In your Jupyter notebook:**

When you launch the :ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` in your notebook, you
should now see the App as expected!

.. code:: python

    # Launch the App in a notebook cell
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)  # port=YYYY

If you chose a port `YYYY` other than the default `5151`, you will need to
specify it when launching App instances per the commented argument above.

Note that you can also open the App
:ref:`in a dedicated tab <opening-app-dedicated-tab>`:

.. code:: python

    # Launch the App in a dedicated browser tab
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, auto=False)  # port=YYYY
    session.open_tab()

.. _docker:

Docker
______

The FiftyOne repository contains a
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_
that you can use/customize to build and run Docker images containing source
or release builds of FiftyOne.

Building an image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, clone the repository:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone
    cd fiftyone

If you want a source install of FiftyOne, then build a wheel:

.. code:: shell

    make python

If you want to install a FiftyOne release, then make the suggested modification
in the
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_.

Next, build the image:

.. code:: shell

    docker build -t voxel51/fiftyone .

The default image uses Python 3.11, but you can customize these
via optional build arguments:

.. code:: shell

    docker build \
        --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.10 \
        -t voxel51/fiftyone .

Refer to the
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_ for
additional Python packages that you may wish to include in your build.

Running an image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The image is designed to persist all data in a single `/fiftyone` directory
with the following organization:

.. code:: text

    /fiftyone/
        db/             # FIFTYONE_DATABASE_DIR
        default/        # FIFTYONE_DEFAULT_DATASET_DIR
        zoo/
            datasets/   # FIFTYONE_DATASET_ZOO_DIR
            models/     # FIFTYONE_MODEL_ZOO_DIR

Therefore, to run a container, you should mount `/fiftyone` as a local volume
via `--mount` or `-v`, as shown below:

.. code:: shell

    SHARED_DIR=/path/to/shared/dir

    docker run -v ${SHARED_DIR}:/fiftyone -p 5151:5151 -it voxel51/fiftyone

The `-p 5151:5151` option is required so that when you
:ref:`launch the App <creating-an-app-session>` from within the container you
can connect to it at http://localhost:5151 in your browser.

You can also include the `-e` or `--env-file` options if you need to further
:ref:`configure FiftyOne <configuring-fiftyone>`.

By default, running the image launches an IPython shell, which you can use as
normal:

.. code:: python

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. note::

    Any datasets you create inside the Docker image must refer to media
    files within `SHARED_DIR` or another mounted volume if you intend to work
    with datasets between sessions.

.. note::

    FiftyOne should automatically detect that it is running inside a Docker
    container. However, if you are unable to load the App in your browser, you
    may need to manually :ref:`set the App address <restricting-app-address>`
    to `0.0.0.0`:

    .. code:: python

        session = fo.launch_app(..., address="0.0.0.0")

Connecting to a localhost database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using a
:ref:`self-managed database <configuring-mongodb-connection>` that you
ordinarily connect to via a URI like `mongodb://localhost`, then you will need
to tweak this slightly when working in Docker. See
`this question <https://stackoverflow.com/q/24319662>`_ for details.

On Linux, include `--network="host"` in your `docker run` command and use
`mongodb://127.0.0.1` for your URI.

On Mac or Windows, use `mongodb://host.docker.internal` for your URI.

.. _cloud-storage:

Cloud storage
_____________

For prototyping, it is *possible* to work with data in cloud storage buckets in
FiftyOne by mounting the buckets as local drives.

The following sections describe how to do this in the :ref:`AWS <aws>`,
:ref:`Google Cloud <google-cloud>`, and :ref:`Microsoft Azure <azure>`
environments.

.. warning::

    Mounting cloud buckets using the techniques below is not performant and is
    not recommended or officially supported. It is useful only for prototyping.

    Our recommended, scalable approach to work with cloud-backed data is
    :ref:`FiftyOne Teams <fiftyone-teams>`, an enterprise deployment of
    FiftyOne with multiuser collaboration features, native cloud dataset
    support, and much more!

.. _aws:

AWS
~~~

If your data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket, you can mount the bucket as a local
drive on an EC2 instance and then access the data using the standard workflow
for remote data.

The steps below outline the process.

**Step 1**

`Create an EC2 instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html>`_.

**Step 2**

Now `ssh into the instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html>`_
and :ref:`install FiftyOne <installing-fiftyone>` if necessary.

.. code-block:: shell

    # On remote machine
    pip install fiftyone

.. note::

    You may need to :ref:`install some system packages <compute-instance-setup>`
    on your compute instance instance in order to run FiftyOne.

**Step 3**

Mount the S3 bucket as a local drive.

You can use `s3fs-fuse <https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse>`_ to do this.
You will need to make a `.passwd-s3fs` file that contains your AWS credentials
as outlined in the `s3fs-fuse README <https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse>`_.

.. code-block:: shell

    # On remote machine
    s3fs <bucket-name> /path/to/mount/point \
        -o passwd_file=.passwd-s3fs \
        -o umask=0007,uid=<your-user-id>

**Step 4**

Now that you can access your data from the compute instance, start up Python
and :ref:`create a FiftyOne dataset <loading-datasets>` whose filepaths are in
the mount point you specified above. Then you can launch the App and work with
it locally in your browser using :ref:`remote sessions <remote-data>`.

.. _google-cloud:

Google Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your data is stored in a Google Cloud storage bucket, you can mount the
bucket as a local drive on a GC compute instance and then access the data using
the standard workflow for remote data.

The steps below outline the process.

**Step 1**

`Create a GC compute instance <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux>`_.

**Step 2**

Now `ssh into the instance <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux#connect_to_your_instance>`_
and :ref:`install FiftyOne <installing-fiftyone>` if necessary.

.. code-block:: shell

    # On remote machine
    pip install fiftyone

.. note::

    You may need to :ref:`install some system packages <compute-instance-setup>`
    on your compute instance instance in order to run FiftyOne.

**Step 3**

Mount the GCS bucket as a local drive.

You can use `gcsfuse <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse>`_ to do
this:

.. code-block:: shell

    # On remote machine
    gcsfuse --implicit-dirs my-bucket /path/to/mount

**Step 4**

Now that you can access your data from the compute instance, start up Python
and :ref:`create a FiftyOne dataset <loading-datasets>` whose filepaths are in
the mount point you specified above. Then you can launch the App and work with
it locally in your browser using :ref:`remote sessions <remote-data>`.

.. _azure:

Microsoft Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your data is stored in an Azure storage bucket, you can mount the bucket as
a local drive on an Azure compute instance and then access the data using the
standard workflow for remote data.

The steps below outline the process.

**Step 1**

`Create an Azure compute instance <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal>`_.

**Step 2**

Now
`ssh into the instance <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal#connect-to-virtual-machine>`_
and :ref:`install FiftyOne <installing-fiftyone>` if necessary.

.. code-block:: shell

    # On remote machine
    pip install fiftyone

.. note::

    You may need to :ref:`install some system packages <compute-instance-setup>`
    on your compute instance instance in order to run FiftyOne.

**Step 3**

Mount the Azure storage container in the instance.

This is fairly straightforward if your data is stored in a blob container.
You can use `blobfuse <https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse>`_ for this.

**Step 4**

Now that you can access your data from the compute instance, start up Python
and :ref:`create a FiftyOne dataset <loading-datasets>` whose filepaths are in
the mount point you specified above. Then you can launch the App and work with
it locally in your browser using :ref:`remote sessions <remote-data>`.

.. _compute-instance-setup:

Setting up a cloud instance
___________________________

When you create a fresh cloud compute instance, you may need to install some
system packages in order to install and use FiftyOne.

For example, the script below shows a set of commands that may be used to
configure a Debian-like Linux instance, after which you should be able to
successfully :ref:`install FiftyOne <installing-fiftyone>`.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Example setup script for a Debian-like virtual machine

    # System packages
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt -y upgrade
    sudo apt install -y build-essential
    sudo apt install -y unzip
    sudo apt install -y cmake
    sudo apt install -y cmake-data
    sudo apt install -y pkg-config
    sudo apt install -y libsm6
    sudo apt install -y libxext6
    sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
    sudo apt install -y libffi-dev
    sudo apt install -y libxml2-dev
    sudo apt install -y libxslt1-dev
    sudo apt install -y zlib1g-dev
    sudo apt install -y python3
    sudo apt install -y python-dev
