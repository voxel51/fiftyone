**The open-source tool for building high-quality datasets and computer vision models**

Nothing hinders the success of machine learning systems more than poor quality
data. And without the right tools, improving a model can be time-consuming and
inefficient.

FiftyOne supercharges your machine learning workflows by enabling you to
visualize datasets and interpret models faster and more effectively.

Improving data quality and understanding your model's failure modes are the
most impactful ways to boost the performance of your model.

FiftyOne provides the building blocks for optimizing your dataset analysis
pipeline. Use it to get hands-on with your data, including visualizing complex
labels, evaluating your models, exploring scenarios of interest, identifying
failure modes, finding annotation mistakes, and much more!

FiftyOne Library
----------------

FiftyOne's core library provides a structured yet dynamic representation to
explore your datasets. You can efficiently query and manipulate your dataset by
adding custom tags, model predictions and more.

.. custombutton::
    :button_text: Explore the library
    :button_link: user_guide/basics.html

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.Dataset("my_dataset")

    sample = fo.Sample(filepath="/path/to/image.png")
    sample.tags.append("train")
    sample["custom_field"] = 51

    dataset.add_sample(sample)

    view = dataset.match_tags("train").sort_by("custom_field").limit(10)

    for sample in view:
        print(sample)

.. note::

    FiftyOne is designed to be lightweight and flexible, making it easy to load
    your datasets. FiftyOne supports loading datasets in a variety of common
    formats out-of-the-box, and it also provides the extensibility to load
    datasets in custom formats.

    Check out :doc:`loading datasets <user_guide/dataset_creation/index>` to see
    how to load your data into FiftyOne.

FiftyOne App
------------

The FiftyOne App is a graphical user interface that makes it easy to explore
and rapidly gain intuition into your datasets. You can visualize labels like
bounding boxes and segmentations overlaid on the samples; sort, query and
slice your dataset into any subset of interest; and more.

   rank_view = dataset.sort_by("uniqueness")

FiftyOne Plugins
----------------

FiftyOne provides a powerful plugin framework that allows for extending and
customizing the functionality of the tool to suit your specific needs.

With plugins, you can add new functionality to the FiftyOne App, create
integrations with other tools and APIs, render custom panels, and add custom
buttons to menus.

With :ref:`FiftyOne Teams <teams-delegated-operations>`, you can even write
plugins that allow users to execute long-running tasks from within the App that
run on a connected compute cluster.
