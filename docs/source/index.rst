FiftyOne
========

*"Rapidly experiment with your datasets"*

If you are looking to boost the performance of your machine learning models,
chances are improving the quality of your dataset will provide the highest
return on your investment. **Enter FiftyOne.** FiftyOne is a Python-based tool
for the visual data scientist that enables you to create valuable and diverse
datasets. Work efficiently with FiftyOne to achieve better models with
dependable performance.

*"Become one with your data"*

FiftyOne does more than improve your dataset; it gets you closer to your data.
Rapidly gain insight by visualizing samples overlayed with with dynamic and
queryable fields such as ground truth and predicted labels, dataset splits, and
much more!

Core Concepts
_____________

The FiftyOne tool has three components: the core library, the App, and the
Brain.

:doc:`FiftyOne Core Library <user_guide/basics>`
------------------------------------------------

FiftyOne's core library provides a structured yet dynamic representation to
explore your datasets. You can efficiently query and manipulate your dataset by
adding custom tags, model predictions and more.

.. custombutton::
    :button_text: Explore the Core Library
    :button_link: user_guide/basics.html

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.Dataset("my_dataset")

    sample = fo.Sample(filepath="path/to/img.png")
    sample.tags.append("train")
    sample["custom_field"] = 51

    dataset.add_sample(sample)

    view = dataset.match_tag("train").sort_by("custom_field").limit(10)

    for sample in view:
        print(sample)

.. note::

    FiftyOne is designed to be lightweight and flexible, making it easy to load
    your datasets. FiftyOne supports loading datasets in a variety of common
    formats out-of-the-box, and it also provides the extensibility to load
    datasets in custom formats.

    Check out :doc:`loading datasets <user_guide/dataset_creation/index>` to see
    how to load your data into FiftyOne!

:doc:`FiftyOne App <user_guide/app>`
------------------------------------

The FiftyOne App is a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to
rapidly gain intuition into your datasets. You can visualize labels, bounding
boxes and segmentations overlayed on the samples; sort, query and slice your
dataset into any aspect you need; and more.

:doc:`FiftyOne Brain <user_guide/brain>`
----------------------------------------

The FiftyOne Brain is a library of powerful machine learning-powered
:ref:`capabilities <Core Capabilities>` that provide insights into your
datasets and recommend ways to modify your datasets that will lead to
measurably better performance of your models.
