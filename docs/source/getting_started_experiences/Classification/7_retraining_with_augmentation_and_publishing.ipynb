    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed the entire workflow from data exploration to model training, analysis, and targeted improvement. You've seen how a generalist model like CLIP provides a baseline, and how a specialized, supervised model can achieve superior performance. Most importantly, you've learned how to use model predictions and embeddings to analyze your dataset, find problematic samples, and use that information to make your model even better.\n",
