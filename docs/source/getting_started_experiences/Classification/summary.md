# Image Classification Getting Started Series Summary

This comprehensive series has walked you through the core components of working with classification data in FiftyOne: from loading and visualizing datasets, to creating embeddings, evaluating models, and finding and fixing data quality issues.

## Summary of Steps

### Step 1: Understanding the MNIST Dataset

We explored the MNIST dataset's structure, loaded it into FiftyOne, and computed metadata to understand its basic properties and ensure it was a suitable benchmark.

### Step 2: Creating and Visualizing Image Embeddings

We learned how neural networks represent images as high-dimensional vectors. We generated embeddings with a pre-trained CLIP model and visualized them using PCA and UMAP to understand image similarity and natural clustering.

### Step 3: Zero-shot Classification with CLIP

We discovered how modern vision-language models can classify images without explicit training on our dataset. We used CLIP to perform zero-shot classification, establishing a powerful performance baseline with minimal effort.

### Step 4: Traditional Supervised Classification

We built a custom Convolutional Neural Network (LeNet-5) from scratch in PyTorch, covering the fundamentals of supervised learning, including defining architectures, creating training loops, and using a validation set for checkpointing.

### Step 5: Bridging FiftyOne and PyTorch

We mastered the integration between FiftyOne's dataset management and PyTorch's training capabilities, converting FiftyOne views to PyTorch `DataLoaders` while maintaining metadata and handling preprocessing efficiently.

### Step 6: Analyzing Model Predictions and Features

We interpreted model behavior by examining prediction confidence, hardness, and mistakenness. We also extracted embeddings from our own trained model's intermediate layers to analyze its learned features and identify unique or problematic training samples.

### Step 7: Data Augmentation and Fine-Tuning

We improved our model's performance through principled data augmentation. By identifying samples the model struggled with, applying targeted augmentations, and fine-tuning, we addressed specific weaknesses and boosted overall accuracy.

## Suggested Exercises

1.  **Sample Quality Analysis**: We focused on augmenting misclassified samples. Try augmenting different subsets, such as the most unique samples or those with the highest hardness scores. Does this improve performance?
2.  **Active Learning**: Use the uniqueness, hardness, and confidence metrics to implement a simple [active learning pipeline](https://voxel51.com/blog/supercharge-your-annotation-workflow-with-active-learning) that selects the most informative samples for augmentation.
3.  **Dataset Exploration**: Apply these techniques to other classification datasets from the Zoo, like [CIFAR-10](https://docs.voxel51.com/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-cifar10) or [Fashion-MNIST](https://docs.voxel51.com/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-fashion-mnist).
4.  **Architecture Comparison**: Implement and compare a different CNN architecture (e.g., a simple ResNet block) on MNIST.
5.  **CLIP Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different text prompts for CLIP's zero-shot classification. How much can you improve its 88% baseline accuracy on MNIST just by changing the prompt?
