These are grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, with each pixel value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). The images have been size-normalized and centered, making them ideal for learning fundamental computer vision concepts without the complexity of dealing with varying scales, rotations, or backgrounds found in natural images. You can inspect the samples on the test portion of the dataset through [try.fiftyone.ai](https://try.fiftyone.ai/datasets/mnist/samples).\n",

First, it provided the research community with a common benchmark that was computationally tractable, even early personal computers could train models on MNIST in reasonable time. Second, its simplicity allowed researchers to focus on algorithmic innovations rather than data preprocessing challenges. Landmark achievements in deep learning, from early multilayer perceptrons to convolutional architectures like LeNet-5, were first demonstrated and validated on MNIST.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset served as a proving ground for fundamental concepts of modern computer vision: convolutional neural networks, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms were all tested on these handwritten digits. Many techniques that seem obvious today, like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization, were first explored and validated using MNIST as a testbed.\n",

        "\n",
        "While critics sometimes dismiss MNIST as \"too easy\" for modern standards, it continues to serve crucial educational and research purposes. For newcomers to computer vision, MNIST provides an ideal environment to understand core concepts without overwhelming complexity. The dataset is small enough to experiment with quickly, yet rich enough to demonstrate important phenomena like overfitting, the importance of data augmentation, and the impact of architectural choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, MNIST's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Achieving state-of-the-art performance >99.7% accuracy requires sophisticated techniques and careful attention to detail, making it an interesting benchmark for testing new methodologies.\n",

While a model trained specifically on MNIST might achieve 99%+ accuracy, applying a general-purpose vision model like CLIP without any MNIST-specific training provides insights into how well these models generalize and what they've learned about visual patterns from their massive training datasets.\n",

Traditional computer vision models are trained on fixed sets of image categories, but CLIP was trained on 400 million image-text pairs from the internet, learning to match images with their captions. This training enables CLIP to perform \"zero-shot\" classification: the ability to classify images into categories it has not seen during training by comparing the image representation with text descriptions of potential classes. The model works by encoding both images and text into the same high-dimensional embedding space, where similar concepts cluster together, allowing it to determine which text description best matches a given image through similarity comparison.\n",

        "In [OpenAI's 2021 CLIP paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), the comparison with MNIST revealed fascinating insights about zero-shot learning capabilities. While supervised models trained specifically on MNIST achieve near-perfect accuracy (>99.7%), OpenAI's best performing variant of CLIP (trained on about 400 million image-text pairs) achieved only 88% accuracy on these handwritten digits. This is interesting considering the model was not trained explicitly trained on any variant of this dataset. This comparison highlighted a shift in modern computer vision from specialized models that excel at narrow tasks to general models that perform reasonably well across diverse domains. The 11+ percentage point gap between supervised and zero-shot approaches on MNIST demonstrates both the power and limitations of general-purpose vision-language models, making MNIST an excellent case study for understanding the trade-offs between specialized optimization and general-purpose learning, particularly valuable for exploring modern approaches like few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and transfer learning strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the variant of CLIP that we use in our experiments of this notebook, `\"clip-vit-base32-torch\"` (a Vit-B/32 model) is *not* the top performing variant of CLIP that is showcased on the original OpenAI paper. That would be \"ViT-L/14@336px\", a bigger vision transformer model. The Vit-B/32 base models remain interesting and widely used due to their lower number of parameters.\n",

The academic community has identified [several of these ambiguous samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05283). These labeling inconsistencies, while representing less than 0.1% of the dataset, provide opportunities to explore data quality assessment techniques.\n",

In production systems, you'll inevitably encounter ambiguous samples, annotation errors, and edge cases.

        "**Zero-shot classification** leverages pre-trained models like CLIP that have learned rich visual representations from massive datasets, allowing them to classify images into \"interpolated\" categories they've not explicitly seen during training. These models understand the semantic relationship between images and text descriptions, enabling classification through natural language prompts like \"a photo of the digit 3\" without requiring any task-specific training data. In contrast, **traditional supervised training** requires labeled examples for each class you want to predict. You must provide the model with many of images of each digit along with their correct labels, then train the network to learn the mapping from pixel patterns to class labels through backpropagation. While supervised training often achieves higher accuracy on specific datasets and allows for domain-specific optimization, zero-shot approaches offer remarkable flexibility and can instantly work on new classification tasks without additional training time or computational resources."

        "A FiftyOne dataset wraps together the annotations and image data into a unified, queryable structure that makes computer vision workflows seamless. Unlike traditional approaches where you might manage separate files for images and labels, FiftyOne treats each sample as a rich object containing the image itself, ground truth labels, metadata, and any predictions or embeddings you add later. This design enables powerful operations like filtering by class imbalance, visualizing prediction confidence, or finding samples with specific characteristics, all through a consistent API.\n",

        "While zero-shot classification with CLIP demonstrates the power of modern pre-trained models, understanding how to build and train convolutional neural networks from scratch remains fundamental to computer vision. **LeNet-5**, proposed by Yann LeCun in 1998, represents one of the earliest and most influential CNN architectures. Despite its age, LeNet-5 perfectly illustrates core CNN concepts including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and the transition from feature extraction to classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "LeNet-5's architecture is elegantly simple yet effective: it uses alternating convolutional and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The network learns low-level features like edges and curves in early layers, then combines these into higher-level digit patterns in deeper layers. This hierarchical feature learning principle underlies virtually all modern CNN architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "For MNIST digit classification, LeNet-5 provides an excellent baseline to compare against CLIP's zero-shot performance. While CLIP leverages massive-scale pre-training and vision-language understanding, LeNet-5 demonstrates what's possible with task-specific supervised learning on a much smaller scale. Building this model from scratch in PyTorch teaches essential concepts about gradient-based optimization, backpropagation, and the relationship between network architecture and learning capacity.\n",

        "\n",
        "The **validation set** serves as an unbiased evaluation mechanism during model development, acting as a proxy for real-world performance before touching the final test set. While the training set teaches the model to recognize patterns in handwritten digits, the validation set reveals whether the model has truly learned generalizable features or simply memorized the training data, a phenomenon known as overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, we monitor both training and validation **loss** simultaneously. **Loss** is a numerical measure of how far off the model's predictions are from the correct answers - lower loss means better performance. We use categorical cross-entropy loss, which penalizes confident wrong predictions more heavily than uncertain ones. **Training loss** typically decreases steadily as the model learns, but **validation loss** tells the real story. If validation loss plateaus or begins increasing while training loss continues decreasing, the model is overfitting and memorizing training-specific details rather than learning robust digit recognition patterns. This signals when to stop training, adjust hyperparameters, or modify the architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "The validation set also enables **hyperparameter tuning** without contaminating our final evaluation. We can experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, regularization techniques, or architectural modifications, using validation loss to guide these decisions. Each configuration gets evaluated on the same held-out validation data, ensuring fair comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important: the test set remains completely untouched** throughout the development process. Only after we've selected our final model configuration based on validation performance do we evaluate on the test set once, giving us an honest estimate of how the model will perform on truly unseen data. This three-way split (train/validation/test) is fundamental to responsible machine learning development and prevents the subtle \"data leakage\" that can make models appear better than they actually are."

        "To train our PyTorch model, we need to convert our FiftyOne dataset views into PyTorch `Dataset` objects that can load and preprocess images during training. This bridge between FiftyOne's dataset management and PyTorch's training pipeline is important for maintaining both the metadata and annotations while enabling batch processing. PyTorch's `Dataset` class provides a standardized interface for data loading, handling tasks like image loading, preprocessing transforms, and label conversion. By creating a custom dataset class that works with FiftyOne's file paths and labels, we can leverage PyTorch's `DataLoader` for batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading while preserving all the dataset analysis capabilities that FiftyOne provides. This approach allows us to move between FiftyOne's visual analysis and PyTorch's training workflows without duplicating data or losing the rich metadata we've computed."

        "\n",
        "**Why Standard Scaling Matters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gradient Optimization**: Neural networks learn through gradient descent, which works best when input features are on similar scales. Without scaling, features with larger magnitudes (like raw pixel values 0-255) can dominate the gradient updates, leading to slower convergence and unstable training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weight Initialization Compatibility**: Modern weight initialization schemes (Xavier, He initialization) assume inputs are roughly centered around zero with unit variance. Standard scaling ensures our data matches these assumptions, preventing vanishing or exploding gradients during early training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Activation Function Efficiency**: Many activation functions (tanh, sigmoid) work optimally when inputs are centered around zero. Scaled inputs help neurons operate in the most responsive regions of these functions rather than saturating in flat regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Rate Stability**: With standardized inputs, we can use higher learning rates without instability, as the optimization landscape becomes more uniform across different dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For MNIST images, we transform raw pixel values from the range [0, 255] to approximately [-1, 1] with mean ≈ 0, creating a more favorable training environment that typically results in faster convergence and better final performance.\n"

When training loss continues decreasing while validation loss plateaus or increases, this indicates overfitting where the model memorizes training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. If both curves plateau at high values, the model may be underfitting and require more capacity (e.g.more layers or more weights) or more training epochs."

        "Careful data augmentation has the potential to help with misclassified samples: By specifically targeting the samples that our model struggled with during initial training, we can create additional training examples that help the model learn to handle these edge cases more effectively. However we must do this carefully in order to not damage the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small rotations and elastic deformations are effective for handwritten digits: These transformations mimic natural variations in human handwriting without making digits ambiguous. The key is finding the right balance - enough variation to improve robustness, but not so much that a \"6\" looks like a \"9\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning with augmented data can improve model robustness: Rather than training from scratch, fine-tuning the already-trained model with augmented versions of problematic samples allows us to specifically address weaknesses while preserving the knowledge already learned.\n",

        "This comprehensive series walks you through the core components of working with\n",
        "classification data in FiftyOne: from loading and visualizing datasets, to creating embeddings, evaluating models, and finding systematic errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary of Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Understanding the MNIST Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "Explore the MNIST dataset structure and load it into FiftyOne. Learn about the 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, and understand why this dataset remains fundamental for classification research.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Creating and Visualizing Image Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "Learn how neural networks represent images as high-dimensional vectors. Generate embeddings with CLIP and visualize them using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP to understand image similarity and clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Zero-shot Classification with CLIP\n",
        "\n",
        "Discover how modern vision-language models can classify images without explicit training on your dataset. Use pre-computed embeddings to perform efficient zero-shot classification with meaningful text prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Evaluating Dataset Quality through Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "Assess your dataset's composition by analyzing embedding distributions. Learn to identify representative samples, outliers, and potential data quality issues using FiftyOne's analysis capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Traditional Supervised Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "Build a custom Convolutional Neural Network (LeNet-5) from scratch in PyTorch. Understand the fundamentals of supervised learning including convolutional layers, training loops, and optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 6: Bridging FiftyOne and PyTorch\n",
        "\n",
        "Master the integration between FiftyOne's dataset management and PyTorch's training capabilities. Convert datasets to DataLoaders while maintaining metadata and handling preprocessing efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 7: Model Comparison and Benchmarking\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare your custom CNN against CLIP's zero-shot classification using FiftyOne's evaluation framework. Learn comprehensive evaluation metrics and statistical significance testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 8: Analyzing Model Predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpret model behavior by examining prediction confidence and identifying hard samples. Use logit analysis to find systematic misclassification patterns and debug model failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 9: Data Augmentation Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "Improve model performance through principled data augmentation. Learn which geometric transformations and elastic deformations help MNIST classification while avoiding destructive augmentations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 10: Advanced Error Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Create targeted views of model failures using FiftyOne's visualization capabilities. Identify false positives, false negatives, and the most problematic samples for systematic model improvement.\n",

        "## Suggested Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sample Quality Analysis**: Notice that we computed the uniqueness, representativeness, and hardness of the samples on the training set. Can you create filtered views of other batches of retraining data based on them?\n",
        "\n",
        "Try:\n",
        "* Selecting the most unique samples or those with highest hardness scores for additional augmentation\n",
        "* Filtering out the most ambiguous or questionable cases out of the fine-tuning training data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Active Learning**: Use the uniqueness, representativeness and hardness metrics to implement an [active learning pipeline](https://voxel51.com/blog/supercharge-your-annotation-workflow-with-active-learning) that selects the most informative samples for manual annotation or additional augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dataset Exploration**: Apply these techniques to other classification datasets like [CIFAR-10](https://docs.voxel51.com/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-cifar10) or [Fashion-MNIST](https://docs.voxel51.com/dataset_zoo/datasets.html#dataset-zoo-fashion-mnist)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Architecture Comparison**: Implement and compare different CNN architectures (e.g. [Network in Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385)) on MNIST\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained ImageNet models and fine-tune them for digit classification\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Custom Augmentations**: Design and test novel augmentation strategies specific to handwritten digits, try augmenting the dataset [adding colors to the digits](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/colored-mnist) and see how this change impacts the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **CLIP Model Variants and Prompting**: Experiment with different CLIP model variants available in FiftyOne's Model Zoo and compare their zero-shot performance on MNIST. Test how different text prompts affect accuracy across model sizes."
