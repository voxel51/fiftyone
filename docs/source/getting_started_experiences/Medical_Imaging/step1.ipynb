    "In FiftyOne, working with CT Scans can be a bit more tricky. CT Scans can come in multiple different file formats that all have slight variations. In order to ingest these files, we need to manually slice them ourselves. The main file formats used for CT scans are DICOM (`.dcm`), NIfTI (`.nii` or `nii.gz`), NRRD (`.nrrd`), or occasionally MHA/MHD (`.mha`, `.mhd` + `.raw`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The good new is if it is stored in DICOM format, you can follow the instructions above! If it is one of the other formats, we need to define what are base atomic sample is and store that as image. This means loading a NIfTI file for example, defining the slice in python, and then saving it back with `opencv` or a similar tool. We will show an example below using NIfTI files with masks.\n",
