Detection datasets usually come in a standard format that FiftyOne can load in one or two lines for you, making creating datasets fast and easy! However, not all datasets come in a known format and sometimes we have to add the detections on manually ourselves. With just a few more steps, FiftyOne still makes loading custom datasets easy. \n",

While uncommon, certain datasets tools will rename or move certain files, such as `data.yaml` in a YOLO dataset instead of `dataset.yaml`. \n",
