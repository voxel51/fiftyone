Step-by-Step Recap
------------------

**Step 1: Getting Started with Medical Imaging**

You learned how to load medical imaging datasets in FiftyOne, specifically working with DICOM and CT scan formats. This included downloading sample datasets from Kaggle, understanding how to load DICOM files with RT Structure Set annotations, and working with NIfTI format CT scans. You mastered the concept of volumetric data visualization and how to create dynamic video representations of multi-slice medical images.

Suggested Exercises
------------------

1. **Multi-Patient Analysis**: Load multiple patient datasets and compare their scans. How can you organize and analyze data across different patients?

2. **Segmentation Analysis**: Work with different types of segmentation masks (lungs, infections, organs) and analyze their quality and coverage.

3. **Dynamic Grouping**: Experiment with different grouping strategies for your medical data. How does dynamic grouping help with volumetric visualization?

4. **Custom Annotations**: Create your own segmentation masks or annotations for specific medical conditions or regions of interest.

5. **Dataset Curation**: Use FiftyOne's filtering and search capabilities to identify specific medical conditions or scan types in your dataset.

What to Do Next
---------------

Now that you've mastered medical imaging with FiftyOne, here are some suggested next steps:

* **Explore Model Evaluation** - Learn how to evaluate segmentation models by comparing predictions against ground truth, and identifying failure cases in your medical dataset

* **Try Out FiftyOne Plugins** - Extend your workflow with powerful plugins like video embeddings, active learning tools, and integrations with medical annotation platforms

* **Build Custom Workflows** - Create domain-specific workflows for your particular medical imaging use case (radiology, pathology, research, etc.)

* **Join the Community** - Connect with other FiftyOne users to share insights and learn advanced medical imaging techniques

* **Apply to Real Projects** - Use these skills on your production medical imaging datasets to improve data quality and model performance
