.. _fiftyone-app:

Using the FiftyOne App
======================

.. default-role:: code

The FiftyOne App is a powerful graphical user interface that enables you to
visualize, browse, and interact directly with your
:ref:`datasets <using-datasets>`.

.. image:: /images/app/app-filters.gif
   :alt: app-filters
   :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? You can use FiftyOne's
    :ref:`plugin framework <fiftyone-plugins>` to customize and extend the
    behavior of the App!

App environments
________________

The FiftyOne App can be used in any environment that you're working in, from
a local IPython shell, to a remote machine or cloud instance, to a Jupyter or
Colab notebook. Check out the :ref:`environments guide <environments>` for best
practices when working in each environment.

.. _app-sessions:

Sessions
________

The basic FiftyOne workflow is to open a Python shell and load a |Dataset|.
From there you can launch the FiftyOne App and interact with it
programmatically via a *session*.

.. _creating-an-app-session:

Creating a session
------------------

You can launch an instance of the App by calling
:func:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>`. This method returns a
|Session| instance, which you can subsequently use to interact programmatically
with the App!

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    session = fo.launch_app()

.. image:: /images/app/app-empty.png
   :alt: app-empty
   :align: center

App sessions are highly flexible. For example, you can launch
:ref:`launch multiple App instances <faq-multiple-apps>` and connect multiple
App instances to the  :ref:`same dataset <faq-multiple-sessions-same-dataset>`.

By default, when you're working in a non-notebook context, the App will be
opened in a new tab of your web browser. See
:ref:`this FAQ <faq-supported-browsers>` for supported browsers.

.. note::

    :func:`fo.launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>` will launch the
    App asynchronously and return control to your Python process. The App will
    then remain connected until the process exits.

    Therefore, if you are using the App in a script, you should use
    :meth:`session.wait() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.wait>` to block
    execution until you close it manually:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Launch the App
        session = fo.launch_app(...)

        # (Perform any additional operations here)

        # Blocks execution until the App is closed
        session.wait()

        # Or block execution indefinitely with a negative wait value
        # session.wait(-1)

.. note::

    When working inside a Docker container, FiftyOne should automatically
    detect and appropriately configure networking. However, if you are unable
    to load the App in your browser, you many need to manually
    :ref:`set the App address <restricting-app-address>` to `0.0.0.0`:

    .. code:: python

        session = fo.launch_app(..., address="0.0.0.0")

    See :ref:`this page <docker>` for more information about working with
    FiftyOne inside Docker.

.. note::

    If you are a Windows user launching the App from a script, you should use
    the pattern below to avoid
    `multiprocessing issues <https://stackoverflow.com/q/20360686>`_, since the
    App is served via a separate process:

    .. code-block:: python

        import fiftyone as fo

        dataset = fo.load_dataset(...)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Ensures that the App processes are safely launched on Windows
            session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
            session.wait()

Updating a session's dataset
----------------------------

Sessions can be updated to show a new |Dataset| by updating the
:meth:`Session.dataset <fiftyone.core.session.Session.dataset>` property of the
session object:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("cifar10")

    # View the dataset in the App
    session.dataset = dataset

.. image:: /images/app/app-scroll.gif
   :alt: app-scroll
   :align: center

Updating a session's view
-------------------------

You can also show a specific :ref:`view <using-views>` into the current dataset
in the App by setting the
:meth:`Session.view <fiftyone.core.session.Session.view>` property of the
session.

For example, the command below loads a |DatasetView| in the App that shows the
first 10 samples in the dataset sorted by their `uniqueness` field:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    session.view = dataset.sort_by("uniqueness").limit(10)

.. image:: /images/app/app-views1.gif
   :alt: app-views1
   :align: center

.. _loading-a-sample-or-group:

Loading a sample or group
-------------------------

You can immediately load a specific sample
:ref:`in the modal <app-sample-view>` when launching a new |Session| by
providing its ID via the `sample_id` parameter:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    sample_id = dataset.last().id

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, sample_id=sample_id)

You can also programmatically load a sample in the modal on an existing session
by setting its
:meth:`session.sample_id <fiftyone.core.session.Session.sample_id>` property:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    sample_id = dataset.take(1).first().id

    session.sample_id = sample_id

.. note::

    Did you know? You can link directly to a sample by copy + pasting the App's
    URL into your browser search bar!

Similarly, for :ref:`group datasets <groups>`, you can immediately load a
specific group in the modal when launching a new |Session| by providing its ID
via the `group_id` parameter:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-groups")
    group_id = dataset.last().group.id

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, group_id=group_id)

You can also programmatically load a group in the modal on an existing session
by setting its
:meth:`session.group_id <fiftyone.core.session.Session.group_id>` property:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    group_id = dataset.take(1).first().group.id

    session.group_id = group_id

.. note::

    Did you know? You can link directly to a group by copy + pasting the App's
    URL into your browser search bar!

.. _remote-session:

Remote sessions
_______________

If your data is stored on a remote machine, you can forward a session from
the remote machine to your local machine and seamlessly browse your remote
dataset from you web browser.

Check out the :ref:`environments page <environments>` for more information on
possible configurations of local/remote/cloud data and App access.

Remote machine
--------------

On the remote machine, you can load a |Dataset| and launch a remote session
using either the Python library or the CLI.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Python

    Load a |Dataset| and call
    :meth:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>` with the
    ``remote=True`` argument.

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        # On remote machine

        import fiftyone as fo

        dataset = fo.load_dataset("<dataset-name>")

        session = fo.launch_app(dataset, remote=True)  # optional: port=XXXX

    You can use the optional ``port`` parameter to choose the port of your
    remote machine on which to serve the App. The default is ``5151``, which
    can also be customized via the ``default_app_port`` parameter of your
    :ref:`FiftyOne config <configuring-fiftyone>`.

    You can also provide the optional ``address`` parameter to restrict the
    hostnames/IP addresses that can connect to your remote session. See
    :ref:`this page <restricting-app-address>` for more information.

    Note that you can manipulate the `session` object on the remote machine as
    usual to programmatically interact with the App instance that you'll
    connect to locally next.

  .. group-tab:: CLI

    Run the :ref:`fiftyone app launch <cli-fiftyone-app-launch>` command in a
    terminal:

    .. code-block:: shell

        # On remote machine

        fiftyone app launch <dataset-name> --remote  # optional: --port XXXX

    You can use the optional ``--port`` flag to choose the port of your
    remote machine on which to serve the App. The default is ``5151``, which
    can also be customized via the ``default_app_port`` parameter of your
    :ref:`FiftyOne config <configuring-fiftyone>`.

.. _remote-app-local-machine:

Local machine
-------------

On the local machine, you can access an App instance connected to the remote
session by either manually configuring port forwarding or via the FiftyOne CLI:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Manual

    Open a new terminal window on your local machine and execute the following
    command to setup port forwarding to connect to your remote session:

    .. code-block:: shell

        # On local machine
        ssh -N -L 5151:127.0.0.1:XXXX [<username>@]<hostname>

    Leave this process running and open http://localhost:5151 in your browser
    to access the App.

    In the above, `[<username>@]<hostname>` specifies the remote machine to
    connect to, `XXXX` refers to the port that you chose when you launched the
    session on your remote machine (the default is 5151), and `5151` specifies
    the local port to use to connect to the App (and can be customized).

  .. group-tab:: FiftyOne

    If you have FiftyOne installed on your local machine, you can
    :ref:`use the CLI <cli-fiftyone-app-connect>` to automatically configure
    port forwarding and open the App in your browser as follows:

    .. code-block:: shell

        # On local machine
        fiftyone app connect --destination [<username>@]<hostname>

    If you choose a custom port `XXXX` on the remote machine, add a
    ``--port XXXX`` flag to the above command.

    If you would like to use a custom local port to serve the App, add a
    ``--local-port YYYY`` flag to the above command.

.. note::

    Remote sessions are highly flexible. For example, you can connect to
    :ref:`multiple remote sessions <faq-connect-to-multiple-remote-sessions>`
    and run multiple remote sessions
    :ref:`from one machine <faq-serve-multiple-remote-sessions>`.

.. _app-fields-sidebar:

Using the sidebar
_________________

Any labels, tags, and scalar fields can be overlaid on the samples in the App
by toggling the corresponding display options in the App's sidebar:

.. image:: /images/app/app-fields.gif
    :alt: app-fields
    :align: center

If you have :ref:`stored metadata <storing-field-metadata>` on your fields,
then you can view this information in the App by hovering over field or
attribute names in the App's sidebar:

.. image:: /images/app/app-field-tooltips.gif
    :alt: app-field-tooltips
    :align: center

.. _app-filtering:

Filtering sample fields
-----------------------

The App provides UI elements in both grid view and expanded sample view that
you can use to filter your dataset. To view the available filter options for a
field, click the caret icon to the right of the field's name.

Whenever you modify a filter element, the App will automatically update to show
only those samples and/or labels that match the filter.

.. note::

    Did you know? When you
    :ref:`declare custom attributes <dynamic-attributes>` on your dataset's
    schema, they will automatically become filterable in the App!

.. note::

    Did you know? When you have applied filter(s) in the App, a bookmark icon
    appears in the top-left corner of the sample grid. Click this button to
    convert your filters to an equivalent set of stage(s) in the
    :ref:`view bar <app-create-view>`!

.. image:: /images/app/app-filters.gif
   :alt: app-filters
   :align: center

.. _app-indexed-filtering:

Leveraging indexes while filtering
----------------------------------

By default, most sidebar filters require full collection scans to retrieve the
relevant results.

However, you can optimize any sidebar filter(s) of interest by using
:meth:`create_index() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.create_index>`
to index the field or embedded field that you wish to filter by:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("coco-2017", split="validation")

    # Add index to optimize ground truth label filters
    dataset.create_index("ground_truth.detections.label")

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

You can use
:meth:`list_indexes() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_indexes>`
to view the existing indexes on a dataset, and you can use
:meth:`drop_index() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.drop_index>`
to delete indexes that you no longer need.

.. note::

    Use :ref:`summary fields <summary-fields>` to efficiently query frame-level
    fields on large video datasets.

For :ref:`group datasets <groups>`, you should also add a compound index that
includes your group `name` field to optimize filters applied when viewing a
single :ref:`group slice <groups-app>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-groups")

    # Add index to optimize detections label filters in "group" mode
    dataset.create_index("detections.detections.label")

    # Add compound index to optimize detections label filters in "slice" mode
    dataset.create_index([("group.name", 1), ("detections.detections.label", 1)])

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. _app-sidebar-groups:

Sidebar groups
--------------

You can customize the layout of the App's sidebar by creating/renaming/deleting
groups and dragging fields between groups directly in the App:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. image:: /images/app/app-sidebar-groups.gif
    :alt: app-sidebar-groups
    :align: center

.. note::

    Any changes you make to a dataset's sidebar groups in the App are saved on
    the dataset and will persist between sessions.

You can also programmatically modify a dataset's sidebar groups by editing the
:class:`sidebar_groups <fiftyone.core.odm.dataset.DatasetAppConfig>` property
of the :ref:`dataset's App config <dataset-app-config>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Get the default sidebar groups for the dataset
    sidebar_groups = fo.DatasetAppConfig.default_sidebar_groups(dataset)

    # Collapse the `metadata` section by default
    print(sidebar_groups[2].name)  # metadata
    sidebar_groups[2].expanded = False

    # Add a new group
    sidebar_groups.append(fo.SidebarGroupDocument(name="new"))

    # Modify the dataset's App config
    dataset.app_config.sidebar_groups = sidebar_groups
    dataset.save()  # must save after edits

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

You can conveniently reset the sidebar groups to their default state by setting
:class:`sidebar_groups <fiftyone.core.odm.dataset.DatasetAppConfig>` to `None`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Reset sidebar groups
    dataset.app_config.sidebar_groups = None
    dataset.save()  # must save after edits

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. note::

    If a dataset has fields that do not appear in the dataset's
    :class:`sidebar_groups <fiftyone.core.odm.dataset.DatasetAppConfig>`
    property, these fields will be dynamically assigned to default groups in
    the App at runtime.

.. _app-lightning-mode:

Lightning mode
--------------

Lightning mode is a performant sidebar setting for larger datasets that can be
enabled either by adding a `lightning_threshold` to your
:ref:`App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`, or for a particular dataset by
clicking on the "Gear" icon above the sample grid in the App.

.. note::

    When lightning mode is enabled through the "Gear" icon in the App, the
    setting is persisted in your browser for that dataset.

The lightning threshold specifies a dataset/view size (sample count) above
which filters can *only* be applied to fields that have been **indexed**. After
applying filters that bring the current view size below the lightning
threshold, all fields become available for filtering and additional information
like value counts are presented.

.. image:: /images/app/app-lightning-mode.gif
    :alt: app-lightning-mode
    :align: center

The above GIF shows lightning mode in action on the train split of the
:ref:`BDD100K dataset <dataset-zoo-bdd100k>` with an index on the
`metadata.size_bytes` field:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    # The path to the source files that you manually downloaded
    source_dir = "/path/to/dir-with-bdd100k-files"

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "bdd100k",
        split="train",
        source_dir=source_dir,
    )

    dataset.create_index("metadata.size_bytes")

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

The SDK provides a number of useful utilities for managing indexes on your
datasets:

-   :meth:`list_indexes() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_indexes>` -
    list all existing indexes
-   :meth:`create_index() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.create_index>` -
    create a new index
-   :meth:`drop_index() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.drop_index>` -
    drop an existing index
-   :meth:`get_index_information() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_index_information>` -
    get information about the existing indexes

.. note::

    Did you know? You can manage dataset indexes via the App by installing the
    `@voxel51/indexes <https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/indexes>`_
    plugin!

In general, we recommend indexing *only* the specific fields that you wish to
perform initial filters on:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.Dataset()

    # Index specific top-level fields
    dataset.create_index("camera_id")
    dataset.create_index("recorded_at")
    dataset.create_index("annotated_at")
    dataset.create_index("annotated_by")

    # Index specific embedded document fields
    dataset.create_index("ground_truth.detections.label")
    dataset.create_index("ground_truth.detections.confidence")

    # Note: it is faster to declare indexes before adding samples
    dataset.add_samples(...)

    # For illustration, so that any filter brings dataset out of lightning mode
    fo.app_config.lightning_threshold = len(dataset)

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. note::

    Use :ref:`summary fields <summary-fields>` to efficiently query frame-level
    fields on large video datasets.

For :ref:`grouped datasets <groups>`, you should create two indexes for each
field you wish to filter by in lightning mode: the field itself and a compound
index that includes the group slice name:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-groups")

    # Index a specific field
    dataset.create_index("ground_truth.detections.label")
    dataset.create_index([("group.name", 1), ("ground_truth.detections.label", 1)])

    # For illustration, so that any filter brings dataset out of lightning mode
    fo.app_config.lightning_threshold = len(dataset)

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

For datasets with a small number of fields, you can index all fields by adding
a single
`global wildcard index <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-wildcard/create-wildcard-index-all-fields/#std-label-create-wildcard-index-all-fields>`_:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    dataset.create_index("$**")

    # For illustration, so that any filter brings dataset out of lightning mode
    fo.app_config.lightning_threshold = len(dataset)

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. warning::

    For large datasets with many fields, global wildcard indexes may require a
    substantial amount of RAM and query performance may be degraded compared to
    selectively indexing a smaller number of fields.

You can also wildcard index all attributes of a specific embedded document
field:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Wildcard index for all attributes of ground truth detections
    dataset.create_index("ground_truth.detections.$**")

.. note::

    Numeric field filters are not supported by wildcard indexes.

For video datasets with frame-level fields, a separate wildcard index for frame
fields is also necessary:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-video")

    dataset.create_index("$**")
    dataset.create_index("frames.$**")

    # For illustration, so that any filter brings dataset out of lightning mode
    fo.app_config.lightning_threshold = len(dataset)

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. _app-sidebar-mode:

Sidebar mode
------------

Each time you load a new dataset or view in the App, the sidebar will update to
show statistics for the current collection based on the **sidebar mode**:

-   `fast` (*default*): only compute counts for fields whose filter tray is
    expanded
-   `all`: always compute counts for all fields
-   `best`: automatically choose between `fast` and `all` mode based on the
    size of the dataset
-   `disabled`: disable the feature in the App and always choose `fast`

When the sidebar mode is `best`, the App will choose `fast` mode if any of the
following conditions are met:

-   Any dataset with 10,000+ samples
-   Any dataset with 1,000+ samples and 15+ top-level fields in the sidebar
-   Any video dataset with frame-level label fields

You can toggle the sidebar mode dynamically for your current session via the
App's settings menu:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. image:: /images/app/app-sidebar-mode.gif
    :alt: app-sidebar-mode
    :align: center

You can permanently configure the default sidebar mode of a dataset by
modifying the
:class:`sidebar_mode <fiftyone.core.odm.dataset.DatasetAppConfig>` property of
the :ref:`dataset's App config <dataset-app-config>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Set the default sidebar mode to "best"
    dataset.app_config.sidebar_mode = "best"
    dataset.save()  # must save after edits

    session.refresh()

.. _app-create-view:

Using the view bar
__________________

The view bar makes all of the powerful searching, sorting, and filtering
operations :ref:`provided by dataset views <using-views>` available directly in
the App.

.. note::

    Any changes to the current view that you make in the view bar are
    automatically reflected in the |DatasetView| exposed by the
    :meth:`Session.view <fiftyone.core.session.Session.view>` property of the
    App's session object.

.. image:: /images/app/app-views2.gif
    :alt: app-views2
    :align: center

.. _app-dynamic-groups:

Grouping samples
________________

You can use the group action in the App's menu to
:ref:`dynamically group <view-groups>` your samples by a field of your choice:

.. image:: /images/app/app-dynamic-groups.gif
   :alt: dynamic-groups
   :align: center

In this mode, the App's grid shows the first sample from each group, and you
can click on a sample to view all elements of the group in the modal.

You may navigate through the elements of the group either sequentially using 
the carousel, or randomly using the pagination UI at the bottom of the modal.

.. image:: /images/groups/dynamic-groups.gif
   :alt: dynamic-groups-pagination
   :align: center

When viewing *ordered* groups, you have an additional option to render the 
elements of the group as a video.

.. image:: /images/groups/dynamic-groups-frames-as-video.gif
   :alt: dynamic-groups
   :align: center

.. _app-field-visibility:

Field visibility
________________

You can configure which fields of your dataset appear in the App's sidebar by
clicking the settings icon in the upper right of the sidebar to open the Field
visibility modal.

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from datetime import datetime

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    dataset.add_dynamic_sample_fields()

    field = dataset.get_field("ground_truth")
    field.description = "Ground truth annotations"
    field.info = {"creator": "alice", "created_at": datetime.utcnow()}
    field.save()

    field = dataset.get_field("predictions")
    field.description = "YOLOv8 predictions"
    field.info = {"owner": "bob", "created_at": datetime.utcnow()}
    field.save()

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. _app-field-visibility-selection:

Manual selection
----------------

You can use the `Selection` tab to manually select which fields to display.
By default, only top-level fields are available for selection, but if you want
fine-grained control you can opt to include nested fields
(eg :ref:`dynamic attributes <dynamic-attributes>` of your label fields) in the
selection list as well.

.. note::

    You cannot exclude default fields/attributes from your dataset's
    schema, so these rows are always disabled in the Field visibility UI.

Click `Apply` to reload the App with only the specified fields in the sidebar.
When you do so, a filter icon will appear to the left of the settings icon in
the sidebar indicating how many fields are currently excluded. You can reset
your selection by clicking this icon or reopening the modal and pressing the
`Reset` button at the bottom.

   :alt: field-visibility-selection
   :align: center

.. note::

    If your dataset has many fields and you frequently work with different
    subsets of them, you can persist/reload field selections by
    :ref:`saving views <app-saving-views>`.

.. _app-field-visibility-filter-rules:

Filter rules
------------

Alternatively, you can use the `Filter rule` tab to define a rule that is
dynamically applied to the dataset's
:ref:`field metadata <storing-field-metadata>` each time the App loads to
determine which fields to include in the sidebar.

.. note::

    Filter rules are dynamic. If you :ref:`save a view <app-saving-views>` that
    contains a filter rule, the matching fields may increase or decrease over
    time as you modify the dataset's schema.

Filter rules provide a simple syntax with different options for matching
fields:

.. image:: /images/app/app-field-visibility-filter-syntax.jpg
   :alt: field-visibility-filter-syntax
   :align: center

.. note::

    All filter rules are implemented as substring matches against the
    stringified contents of the relevant field metadata.

.. _app-color-schemes:

Color schemes
_____________

You can configure the color scheme used by the App to render content by
clicking on the color palette icon above the sample grid.

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions", gt_field="ground_truth", eval_key="eval"
    )

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. _app-color-schemes-app:

Color schemes in the App
------------------------

The GIF below demonstrates how to:

-   Configure a custom color pool from which to draw colors for otherwise
    unspecified fields/values
-   Configure the colors assigned to specific fields in color by `field` mode
-   Configure the colors used to render specific annotations based on their
    attributes in color by `value` mode
-   Save the customized color scheme as the default for the dataset

.. image:: /images/app/app-color-schemes.gif
   :alt: color-schemes
   :align: center

.. note::

    Any customizations you make only apply to the current dataset. Each time
    you load a new dataset, the color scheme will revert to that dataset's
    default color scheme (if any) or else the global default color scheme.

    To persist a color scheme, you can press `Save as default` to save the
    color scheme as the dataset's default scheme, copy it via the modal's JSON
    viewer, or access it programmatically via
    :meth:`session.color_scheme <fiftyone.core.session.Session.color_scheme>`
    as described below.

The following table describes the available color scheme customization options
in detail:

Color schemes in Python
-----------------------

You can also programmatically configure a session's color scheme by creating
|ColorScheme| instances in Python:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Create a custom color scheme
    fo.ColorScheme(
        color_pool=["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff", "pink", "yellowgreen"],
        fields=[
            {

                    {"value": "fn", "color": "#0000ff"},
                    # true positives: green
                    {"value": "tp", "color": "#00ff00"},
                ]
            },
            {
                "path": "predictions",
                "colorByAttribute": "eval",
                "valueColors": [
                    # false positives: red
                    {"value": "fp", "color": "#ff0000"},
                     # true positives: green
                    {"value": "tp", "color": "#00ff00"}, 
                ]
            },
            {

                    {"intTarget": 12, "color": "#ff0000"},
                     # 15: green
                    {"intTarget": 15, "color": "#00ff00"},
                ]
            }
        ],
        color_by="value",
        opacity=0.5,
        default_colorscale= {"name": "rdbu", "list": None},
        colorscales=[
            {
                 # field definition overrides the default_colorscale
                "path": "heatmap_2",
                 # if name is defined, it will override the list
                "name": None,
                "list": [
                    {"value": 0.0, "color": "rgb(0,255,255)"},
                    {"value": 0.5, "color": "rgb(255,0,0)"},
                    {"value": 1.0, "color": "rgb(0,0,255)"},
                ],
            }
        ],
    )

.. note::

    Refer to the |ColorScheme| class for documentation of the available
    customization options.

You can launch the App with a custom color scheme by passing the optional
`color_scheme` parameter to
:func:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Launch App with a custom color scheme
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, color_scheme=color_scheme)

Once the App is launched, you can retrieve your current color scheme at any
time via the
:meth:`session.color_scheme <fiftyone.core.session.Session.color_scheme>`
property:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    print(session.color_scheme)

You can also dynamically edit your current color scheme by modifying it:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Change the session's current color scheme
    session.color_scheme = fo.ColorScheme(...)

    # Edit the existing color scheme in-place
    session.color_scheme.color_pool = [...]
    session.refresh()

.. note::

    Did you know? You can also configure default color schemes for
    :ref:`individual datasets <dataset-app-config-color-scheme>` via Python!

.. _app-saving-views:

Saving views
____________

You can use the menu in the upper-left of the App to record the current state
of the App's view bar and filters sidebar as a **saved view** into your
dataset:

.. image:: /images/app/app-save-view.gif
    :alt: app-save-view
    :align: center

Saved views are persisted on your dataset under a name of your choice so that
you can quickly load them in a future session via this UI.

Saved views are a convenient way to record semantically relevant subsets of a
dataset, such as:

-   Samples in a particular state, eg with certain tag(s)
-   A subset of a dataset that was used for a task, eg training a model
-   Samples that contain content of interest, eg object types or image
    characteristics

.. note::

    Saved views only store the rule(s) used to extract content from the
    underlying dataset, not the actual content itself. Saving views is cheap.
    Don't worry about storage space!

    Keep in mind, though, that the contents of a saved view may change as the
    underlying dataset is modified. For example, if a save view contains
    samples with a certain tag, the view's contents will change as you
    add/remove this tag from samples.

You can load a saved view at any time by selecting it from the saved view menu:

.. image:: /images/app/app-load-saved-view.gif
    :alt: app-load-saved-view
    :align: center

You can also edit or delete saved views by clicking on their pencil icon:

.. image:: /images/app/app-edit-saved-view.gif
    :alt: app-edit-saved-view
    :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? You can also programmatically create, modify, and delete
    saved views :ref:`via Python <saving-views>`!

.. _app-sample-view:

Viewing a sample
________________

Click a sample to open an expanded view of the sample. This modal also
contains information about the fields of the |Sample| and allows you to access
the raw JSON description of the sample.

.. image:: /images/app/app-expanded.gif
    :alt: app-expanded
    :align: center

If your labels contain many :ref:`dynamic attributes <dynamic-attributes>`, you
may find it helpful to configure which attributes are shown in the tooltip.
To do so, press `ctrl` while hovering over a label to lock the tooltip
in-place and then use the show/hide buttons to customize the display.

.. note::

    Tooltip customizations are persisted in your browser's local storage on a
    per-dataset and per-field basis.

    :align: center

.. _app-image-visualizer:

Using the image visualizer
__________________________

The image visualizer allows you to interactively visualize images along with
their associated labels. When you hover over an image in the visualizer, a
head-up display (HUD) appears with a control bar providing various options.

For example, you can zoom in/out and pan around an image by scrolling and
click-dragging with your mouse or trackpad. You can also zoom tightly into the
currently visible (or selected) labels by clicking on the `Crop` icon in the
controls HUD or using the `z` keyboard shortcut. Press `ESC` to reset your
view.

When multiple labels are overlaid on top of each other, the up and down
arrows offer a convenient way to rotate the z-order of the labels that your
cursor is hovering over, so every label and it's tooltip can be viewed.

The settings icon in the controls HUD contains a variety of options for
customizing the rendering of your labels, including whether to show object
labels, confidences, or the tooltip. The default settings for these parameters
can be configured via the :ref:`App config <app-config>`.

Keyboard shortcuts are available for almost every action. Click the `?` icon
in the controls HUD or use the `?` keyboard shortcut to display the list of
available actions and their associated hotkeys.

.. image:: /images/app/app-image-visualizer.gif
    :alt: image-visualizer
    :align: center

.. note::

    When working in :ref:`Jupyter/Colab notebooks <notebooks>`, you can hold
    down the `SHIFT` key when zoom-scrolling or using the arrow keys to
    navigate between samples/labels to restrict your inputs to the App and thus
    prevent them from also affecting your browser window.

.. _app-video-visualizer:

Using the video visualizer
__________________________

The video visualizer offers all of the same functionality as the image
visualizer, as well as some convenient actions and shortcuts for navigating
through a video and its labels.

There are a variety of additional video-specific keyboard shortcuts. For
example, you can press the spacebar to play/pause the video, and you can press
`0`, `1`, ..., `9` to seek to the 0%, 10%, ..., 90% timestamp in the video.
When the video is paused, you can use `<` and `>` to navigate frame-by-frame
through the video.

Click the `?` icon in the controls HUD or use the `?` keyboard shortcut to
display the list of available actions and their associated hotkeys.

All of the same options in the image settings are available in the video
settings menu in the controls HUD, as well as additional options like whether
to show frame numbers rather than timestamp in the HUD. The default settings
for all such parameters can be configured via the
:ref:`App config <app-config>`.

Playback rate and volume are also available in the video controls HUD.
Clicking on one of the icons resets the setting to the default. And when
hovering, a slider appears to adjust the setting manually.

.. note::

    Did you know? The video visualizer streams frame data on-demand, which
    means that playback begins as soon as possible and even heavyweight label
    types like segmentations are supported!

.. image:: /images/app/app-video-visualizer.gif
    :alt: video-visualizer
    :align: center

.. note::

    When working in :ref:`Jupyter/Colab notebooks <notebooks>`, you can hold
    down the `SHIFT` key when zoom-scrolling or using the arrow keys to
    navigate between samples/labels to restrict your inputs to the App and thus
    prevent them from also affecting your browser window.

.. _app-3d-visualizer:

Using the 3D visualizer
_______________________

The 3D visualizer allows you to interactively visualize
:ref:`3D samples <3d-datasets>` or
:ref:`point cloud samples <point-cloud-datasets>`
along with any associated
:ref:`3D detections <3d-detections>` and :ref:`3D polylines <3d-polylines>`:

.. image:: /images/app/app-new-3d-visualizer.gif
   :alt: 3d-visualizer
   :align: center

The table below summarizes the mouse/keyboard controls that the 3D visualizer
supports:

.. table::
    :widths: 30 30 40

    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | Input        | Action         | Description                   |

    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | B            | Background     | Toggle background on/off      |
    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | F            | Fullscreen     | Toggle fullscreen             |
    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | G            | Grid           | Toggle the grid on/off        |
    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | T            | Top-down       | Reset camera to top-down view |
    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | E            | Ego-view       | Reset the camera to ego view  |
    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    | ESC          | Escape context | Escape the current context    |
    +--------------+----------------+-------------------------------+

A variety of context-specific options are available in a draggable
panel in the 3D visualizer that let you configure lights, as well as
material and visibility of the 3D objects in the scene.

In addition, the HUD at the bottom of the 3D visualizer provides the following
controls:

-   Click the grid icon to toggle the grid on/off
-   Click the `T` to reset the camera to top-down view
-   Click the `E` to reset the camera to ego-view

For point clouds, when coloring by intensity, the color of each point is
computed by mapping the `r` channel of the `rgb` field of the
`PCD file <https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.html>`_
onto a fixed colormap, which is scaled so that the full colormap is matched to
the observed dynamic range of `r` values for each sample.

Similarly, when coloring by height, the `z` value of each point is mapped to
the full colormap using the same strategy.

.. _app-3d-orthographic-projections:

Viewing 3D samples in the grid
------------------------------

When you load 3D collections in the App, any
:ref:`3D detections <3d-detections>` and :ref:`3D polylines <3d-polylines>`
fields will be visualized in the grid using an orthographic projection
(onto the xy plane by default).

In addition, if you have populated
:ref:`orthographic projection images <orthographic-projection-images>` on your
dataset, the projection images will be rendered for each sample in the grid:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.utils.utils3d as fou3d
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    # Load an example 3D dataset
    dataset = (
        foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-groups")
        .select_group_slices("pcd")
        .clone()
    )

    # Populate orthographic projections
    fou3d.compute_orthographic_projection_images(dataset, (-1, 512), "/tmp/proj")

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. image:: /images/app/app-orthographic-projections.gif
    :alt: orthographic-projections
    :align: center

.. _app-3d-visualizer-config:

Configuring the 3D visualizer
-----------------------------

The 3D visualizer can be configured by including any subset of the settings
shown below under the `plugins.3d` key of your
:ref:`App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`:

.. code-block:: json

    // The default values are shown below
    {
        "plugins": {
            "3d": {
                // Whether to show the 3D visualizer
                "enabled": true,

                // The initial camera position in the 3D scene
                "defaultCameraPosition": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},

                }
            }
        }
    }

You can also store dataset-specific plugin settings by storing any subset of
the above values on a :ref:`dataset's App config <dataset-app-config>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Configure the 3D visualizer for a dataset's PCD/Label data
    dataset.app_config.plugins["3d"] = {
        "defaultCameraPosition": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 100},
    }
    dataset.save()

.. note::

    Dataset-specific plugin settings will override any settings from your
    :ref:`global App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`.

.. _app-spaces:

Spaces
______

Spaces provide a customizable framework for organizing interactive Panels of
information within the App.

FiftyOne natively includes the following Panels:

-   :ref:`Samples panel <app-samples-panel>`: the media grid that loads by
    default when you launch the App
-   :ref:`Histograms panel <app-histograms-panel>`: a dashboard of histograms
    for the fields of your dataset
-   :ref:`Embeddings panel <app-embeddings-panel>`: a canvas for working with
    :ref:`embeddings visualizations <brain-embeddings-visualization>`
-   :ref:`Map panel <app-map-panel>`: visualizes the geolocation data of
    datasets that have a |GeoLocation| field

.. note::

    You can also configure custom Panels :ref:`via plugins <fiftyone-plugins>`!

.. image:: /images/app/app-spaces-hero.png

    :align: center

.. _app-spaces-layout:

Configuring spaces in the App
-----------------------------

Consider the following example dataset:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.brain as fob
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    fob.compute_visualization(dataset, brain_key="img_viz")

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

You can configure spaces visually in the App in a variety of ways described
below.

Click the `+` icon in any Space to add a new Panel:

.. image:: /images/app/app-spaces-layout1.gif
    :alt: app-spaces-layout1
    :align: center

When you have multiple Panels open in a Space, you can use the divider buttons
to split the Space either horizontally or vertically:

.. image:: /images/app/app-spaces-layout2.gif
    :alt: app-spaces-layout2
    :align: center

You can rearrange Panels at any time by dragging their tabs between Spaces, or
close Panels by clicking their `x` icon:

.. image:: /images/app/app-spaces-layout3.gif
    :alt: app-spaces-layout3
    :align: center

.. _app-spaces-python:

Configuring spaces in Python
----------------------------

You can also programmatically configure your Space layout and the states of the
individual Panels via the |Space| and |Panel| classes in Python, as shown
below:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    samples_panel = fo.Panel(type="Samples", pinned=True)

    histograms_panel = fo.Panel(
        type="Histograms",
        state=dict(plot="Labels"),
    )

    embeddings_panel = fo.Panel(
        type="Embeddings",
        state=dict(brainResult="img_viz", colorByField="metadata.size_bytes"),
    )

    spaces = fo.Space(
        children=[
            fo.Space(
                children=[
                    fo.Space(children=[samples_panel]),
                    fo.Space(children=[histograms_panel]),
                ],
                orientation="horizontal",
            ),
            fo.Space(children=[embeddings_panel]),
        ],
        orientation="vertical",
    )

The :meth:`children <fiftyone.core.spaces.Space.children>` property of each
|Space| describes what the Space contains, which can be either:

-   A list of |Space| instances. In this case, the Space contains a nested list
    of Spaces, arranged either horizontally or vertically, as per the
    :meth:`orientation <fiftyone.core.spaces.Space.children>` property of the
    parent Space
-   A list of |Panel| instances describing the Panels that should be available
    as tabs within the Space

Set a Panel's :meth:`pinned <fiftyone.core.spaces.Panel.pinned>` property to
`True` if you do not want a Panel's tab to have a close icon `x` in the App.
Each |Panel| also has a :meth:`state <fiftyone.core.spaces.Panel.state>` dict
that can be used to configure the specific state of the Panel to load. Refer to
the sections below for each Panel's available state.

You can launch the App with an initial spaces layout by passing the optional
`spaces` parameter to
:func:`launch_app() <fiftyone.core.session.launch_app>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Launch the App with an initial Spaces layout
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, spaces=spaces)

Once the App is launched, you can retrieve your current layout at any time via
the :meth:`session.spaces <fiftyone.core.session.Session.spaces>` property:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    print(session.spaces)

You can also programmatically configure the App's current layout by setting
:meth:`session.spaces <fiftyone.core.session.Session.spaces>` to any valid
|Space| instance:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Change the session's current Spaces layout
    session.spaces = spaces

.. note::

    Inspecting :meth:`session.spaces <fiftyone.core.session.Session.spaces>` of
    a session whose Spaces layout you've configured in the App is a convenient
    way to discover the available state options for each Panel type!

You can reset your spaces to their default state by setting
:meth:`session.spaces <fiftyone.core.session.Session.spaces>` to None:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Reset spaces layout in the App
    session.spaces = None

.. _app-workspaces:

Saving workspaces
_________________

If you find yourself frequently using/recreating a certain
:ref:`spaces layout <app-spaces>`, you can save it as a workspace with a name
of your choice and then load it later via the App or programmatically!

.. _app-saving-workspaces:

Saving workspaces in the App
----------------------------

Continuing from the :ref:`example above <app-spaces-layout>`, once you've
configured a spaces layout of interest, click the "Unsaved workspace" icon in
the upper right corner to open the workspaces menu and save your current
workspace with a name and optional description/color of your choice:

.. image:: /images/app/app-save-workspace.gif
    :alt: app-save-workspace
    :align: center

.. note::

    Saved workspaces include all aspects of your current spaces layout,
    including panel types, layouts, sizes, and even the current state of each
    panel!

You can load saved workspaces at any time later via this same menu:

.. image:: /images/app/app-load-workspace.gif
    :alt: app-load-workspace
    :align: center

You can also edit the details of an existing saved workspace at any time by
clicking on its pencil icon in the workspace menu:

.. image:: /images/app/app-update-workspace.gif
    :alt: app-update-workspace
    :align: center

.. note::

    If you want to modify the layout of an existing saved workspace, you must
    delete the existing workspace and then re-save it under the same name after
    modifying the layout in the App.

.. _app-saving-workspaces-python:

Saving workspaces in Python
---------------------------

You can also programmatically create and manage saved workspaces!

Use :meth:`save_workspace() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.save_workspace>`
to create a new saved workspace with a name of your choice:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    samples_panel = fo.Panel(type="Samples", pinned=True)

    histograms_panel = fo.Panel(
        type="Histograms",
        state=dict(plot="Labels"),
    )

    embeddings_panel = fo.Panel(
        type="Embeddings",
        state=dict(brainResult="img_viz", colorByField="metadata.size_bytes"),
    )

    workspace = fo.Space(
        children=[
            fo.Space(
                children=[
                    fo.Space(children=[samples_panel]),
                    fo.Space(children=[histograms_panel]),
                ],
                orientation="horizontal",
            ),
            fo.Space(children=[embeddings_panel]),
        ],
        orientation="vertical",
    )

    dataset.save_workspace(
        "my-workspace",
        workspace,
        description="Samples, embeddings, histograms, oh my!",
        color="#FF6D04",
    )

.. note::

    Pro tip! You can save your current spaces layout in the App via
    :meth:`session.spaces <fiftyone.core.session.Session.spaces>`:

    .. code-block:: python

        workspace = session.spaces
        dataset.save_workspace("my-workspace", workspace, ...)

Then in a future session you can load the workspace by name with
:meth:`load_workspace() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.load_workspace>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.load_dataset("quickstart")

    # Retrieve a saved workspace and launch app with it
    workspace = dataset.load_workspace("my-workspace")
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, spaces=workspace)

    # Or, load a workspace on an existing session
    session.spaces = workspace

Saved workspaces have certain editable metadata such as a name, description,
and color that you can view via
:meth:`get_workspace_info() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.get_workspace_info>`
and update via
:meth:`update_workspace_info() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.get_workspace_info>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Get a saved workspace's editable info
    print(dataset.get_workspace_info("my-workspace"))

    # Update the workspace's name and add a description
    info = dict(
        name="still-my-workspace",
        description="Samples, embeddings, histograms, oh my oh my!!",
    )
    dataset.update_workspace_info("my-workspace", info)

    # Verify that the info has been updated
    print(dataset.get_workspace_info("still-my-workspace"))
    # {
    #   'name': 'still-my-workspace',
    #   'description': 'Samples, embeddings, histograms, oh my oh my!!',
    #   'color': None
    # }

You can also use
:meth:`list_workspaces() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.list_workspaces>`,
:meth:`has_workspace() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.has_workspace()>`,
and
:meth:`delete_workspace() <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.delete_workspace>`
to manage your saved workspaces.

.. _app-samples-panel:

Samples panel
_____________

By default, when you launch the App, your spaces layout will contain a single
space with the Samples panel active:

.. image:: /images/app/app-histograms-panel.gif
    :alt: app-histograms-panel
    :align: center

When configuring spaces :ref:`in Python <app-spaces-python>`, you can create a
Samples panel as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    samples_panel = fo.Panel(type="Samples")

.. _app-histograms-panel:

Histograms panel
________________

The Histograms panel in the App lets you visualize different statistics about
the fields of your dataset.

-   The `Sample tags` and `Label tags` modes show the distribution of any
    :ref:`tags <app-tagging>` that you've added to your dataset
-   The `Labels` mode shows the class distributions for each
    :ref:`labels field <using-labels>` that you've added to your dataset. For
    example, you may have histograms of ground truth labels and one more sets
    of model predictions
-   The `Other fields` mode shows distributions for numeric (integer or float)
    or categorical (e.g., string)
    :ref:`primitive fields <adding-sample-fields>` that you've added to your
    dataset. For example, if you computed
    :ref:`uniqueness <brain-image-uniqueness>` on your dataset, a histogram of
    uniqueness values will be available under this mode.

.. note::

    The statistics in the plots automatically update to reflect the current
    :ref:`view <using-views>` that you have loaded in the App!

.. image:: /images/app/app-histograms-panel.gif
    :alt: app-histograms-panel
    :align: center

When configuring spaces :ref:`in Python <app-spaces-python>`, you can define a
Histograms panel as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    histograms_panel = fo.Panel(type="Histograms", state=dict(plot="Labels"))

The Histograms panel supports the following `state` parameters:

-   **plot**: the histograms to plot. Supported values are `"Sample tags"`,
    `"Label tags"`, `"Labels"`, and `"Other fields"`

.. _app-embeddings-panel:

Embeddings panel
________________

When you load a dataset in the App that contains an
:ref:`embeddings visualization <brain-embeddings-visualization>`, you can open
the Embeddings panel to visualize and interactively explore a scatterplot of
the embeddings in the App:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.brain as fob
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # Image embeddings
    fob.compute_visualization(dataset, brain_key="img_viz")

    # Object patch embeddings
    fob.compute_visualization(
        dataset, patches_field="ground_truth", brain_key="gt_viz"
    )

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

Use the two menus in the upper-left corner of the Panel to configure your plot:

-   **Brain key**: the brain key associated with the
    :func:`compute_visualization() <fiftyone.brain.compute_visualization>` run
    to display
-   **Color by**: an optional sample field (or label attribute, for patches
    embeddings) to color the points by

From there you can lasso points in the plot to show only the corresponding
samples/patches in the Samples panel:

.. image:: /images/app/app-embeddings-panel.gif
    :alt: app-embeddings-panel
    :align: center

The embeddings UI also provides a number of additional controls:

-   Press the `pan` icon in the menu (or type `g`) to switch to pan mode, in
    which you can click and drag to change your current field of view
-   Press the `lasso` icon (or type `s`) to switch back to lasso mode
-   Press the `locate` icon to reset the plot's viewport to a tight crop of the
    current view's embeddings
-   Press the `x` icon (or double click anywhere in the plot) to clear the
    current selection

When coloring points by categorical fields (strings and integers) with fewer
than 100 unique classes, you can also use the legend to toggle the visibility
of each class of points:

-   Single click on a legend trace to show/hide that class in the plot
-   Double click on a legend trace to show/hide all other classes in the plot

.. image:: /images/app/app-embeddings-panel-controls.gif
    :alt: app-embeddings-panel-controls
    :align: center

When configuring spaces :ref:`in Python <app-spaces-python>`, you can define an
Embeddings panel as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    embeddings_panel = fo.Panel(
        type="Embeddings",
        state=dict(brainResult="img_viz", colorByField="uniqueness"),
    )

The Embeddings panel supports the following `state` parameters:

-   **brainResult**: the brain key associated with the
    :func:`compute_visualization() <fiftyone.brain.compute_visualization>` run
    to display
-   **colorByField**: an optional sample field (or label attribute, for patches
    embeddings) to color the points by

.. _app-map-panel:

Map panel
_________

When you load a dataset in the App that contains a |GeoLocation| field with
:attr:`point <fiftyone.core.labels.GeoLocation.point>` data populated, you can
open the Map panel to visualize and interactively explore a scatterplot of the
location data:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-geo")

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. note::

    You must configure a
    `Mapbox access token <https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens>`_
    in order to use the Map UI. See below for instructions.

    FiftyOne uses the Mapbox GL JS API,
    `which is free <https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#maps>`_ up to 50,000 map
    loads each month.

.. image:: /images/app/app-map-panel.gif
    :alt: app-map-panel
    :align: center

You can lasso points in the map to show only the corresponding data in the
Samples panel. Confirm the selection by either double-clicking the last
vertex or typing `enter`:

.. image:: /images/app/app-map-panel-selection.gif
    :alt: app-map-panel-selection
    :align: center

The map UI also provides a number of additional controls:

-   Use the menu in the upper-left corner to choose between the available
    map types
-   Press the `locate` icon to reset the map's viewport to a tight crop of the
    current view's location data
-   Press the `x` icon to clear the current selection

.. image:: /images/app/app-map-panel-controls.gif
    :alt: app-map-panel-controls
    :align: center

When configuring spaces :ref:`in Python <app-spaces-python>`, you can define a
Map panel as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    map_panel = fo.Panel(type="Map")

Additionally, the map UI can be configured by including any subset of the
settings shown below under the `plugins.map` key of your
:ref:`App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`:

.. code-block:: json

    // The default values are shown below
    {
        "plugins": {
            "map": {
                // Your mapbox token. This is required
                "mapboxAccessToken": "XXXXXXXX",

                // Whether to enable clustering
                "clustering": true,

                // Never use clustering beyond this zoom level
                // https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/zoom-level
                "clusterMaxZoom": 11,

                // Controls the look and feel of clusters
                "clusters": {
                    "paint": {
                        "circle-color": "rgb(244, 113, 6)",
                        "circle-opacity": 0.7,

                        // Step expressions can be used
                        // https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions-step
                        // 20px circles when point count is less than 10
                        // 30px circles when point count is between 10 and 25
                        // 40px circles when point count is greater than or equal to 25
                        "circle-radius": ["step", ["get", "point_count"], 20, 10, 30, 25, 40]
                    }
                },

                // Controls the look and feel of individual scatter points
                "pointPaint": {
                    "circle-color": "rgb(244, 113, 6)",
                    "circle-opacity": 0.7,
                    "circle-radius": 4
                }
            }
        }
    }

If you prefer, you can provide your Mapbox token by setting the `MAPBOX_TOKEN`
environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export MAPBOX_TOKEN=XXXXXXXX

You can also store dataset-specific plugin settings by storing any subset of
the above values on a :ref:`dataset's App config <dataset-app-config>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Disable clustering for this dataset
    dataset.app_config.plugins["map"] = {"clustering": False}
    dataset.save()

.. note::

    Dataset-specific plugin settings will override any settings from your
    :ref:`global App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`.

.. _app-select-samples:

Selecting samples
_________________

As previously explained, the |Session| object created when you launch the App
lets you interact with the App from your Python process.

One common workflow is to select samples visually in the App and then access
the data for the selected samples in Python. To perform this workflow, first
select some samples in the App:

.. image:: /images/app/app-selection.gif
    :alt: app-selection
    :align: center

|br|
The selected samples checkmark in the options row in the upper-left corner of
the sample grid records the number of samples that you have currently selected.
You can also take actions such as updating the view to only show (or exclude)
the currently selected samples.

Tagging also automatically applies to selected samples or their labels when any
samples are selected. See :ref:`tagging <app-tagging>` for more details.

You can also access the
:meth:`Session.selected <fiftyone.core.session.Session.selected>` property of
your session to retrieve the IDs of the currently selected samples in the App:

.. code-block:: python

    # Print the IDs of the currently selected samples
    print(session.selected)

    # Create a view containing only the selected samples
    selected_view = dataset.select(session.selected)

.. code-block:: text

    ['5ef0eef405059ebb0ddfa6cc',
     '5ef0eef405059ebb0ddfa7c4',
     '5ef0eef405059ebb0ddfa86e',
     '5ef0eef405059ebb0ddfa93c']

.. _app-select-labels:

Selecting labels
_________________

You can also use the App to select individual labels within samples. You can
use this functionality to visually show/hide labels of interest in the App; or
you can access the data for the selected labels from Python, for example by
creating a |DatasetView| that includes/excludes the selected labels.

To perform this workflow, open the expanded sample view by clicking on a sample
in the App. Then click on individual labels to select them:

.. image:: /images/app/app-label-selection.gif
    :alt: app-label-selection
    :align: center

|br|
Selected labels will appear with dotted lines around them. The example above
shows selecting an object detection, but classifications, polygons, polylines,
segmentations, and keypoints can be selected as well.

When you have selected labels in the App, you can use the selected labels
options in the upper-right (the orange checkmark button) to hide these labels
from view or exclude all other labels.

You can also access the
:meth:`Session.selected_labels <fiftyone.core.session.Session.selected_labels>`
property of your session to retrieve information about the currently selected
labels in the App:

.. code-block:: python

    # Print information about the currently selected samples in the App
    fo.pprint(session.selected_labels)

    # Create a view containing only the selected labels
    selected_view = dataset.select_labels(session.selected_labels)

    # Create a view containing everything except the selected labels
    excluded_view = dataset.exclude_labels(session.selected_labels)

.. code-block:: text

    [
        {
            'object_id': '5f99d2eb36208058abbfc02a',
            'sample_id': '5f99d2eb36208058abbfc030',
            'field': 'ground_truth',

        {
            'object_id': '5f99d2eb36208058abbfc02b',
            'sample_id': '5f99d2eb36208058abbfc030',
            'field': 'ground_truth',
        },
        ...
    ]

.. _app-tagging:

Tags and tagging
________________

Tagging is a first-class citizen in FiftyOne, as both |Sample| and |Label|
instances have a ``tags`` attribute that you can use to store arbitrary string
tags for your data.

The FiftyOne API provides methods like
:meth:`tag_samples() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.tag_samples>`
and
:meth:`tag_labels() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.tag_labels>`
that you can use to programmatically manage the tags on your dataset. However,
the App also provides a convenient UI for interactively adding, removing, and
filtering by |Sample| and |Label| tags.

You can tag or untag batches of samples/labels in the App by clicking on the
tag icon above the sample grid.

For example, take the following steps to tag all labels in the ``predictions``
field of a dataset:

-   Make sure that ``predictions`` is the only |Label| field checked in the
    filters sidebar
-   Click the tag icon in the top-left corner of the grid
-   Select `Labels`, type in the tag, and then click `Apply`

You can also use the tag menu to remove existing tags.

.. note::

    Any tagging operations that you perform using the tagging UI above the
    sample grid will be applied to your **current view**, respecting any
    filters or show/hide checkboxes you have applied in the filters sidebar,
    unless you have selected individual samples, in which case the operation
    will only apply to the **selected samples**.

.. image:: /images/app/app-tagging-samples.gif
    :alt: app-tagging-samples
    :align: center

|br|
The App also supports tagging data in individual samples when you have opened
the expanded sample view by clicking on a sample. The tag icon is located in
the top-right corner of the modal.

.. note::

    Any tagging operations that you perform using the tagging UI in expanded
    sample mode will be applied to the **current sample**, respecting any
    filters or show/hide checkboxes you have applied, unless you have selected
    individual labels, in which case the operation will only apply to the
    **selected labels**. The latter may span multiple samples.

.. image:: /images/app/app-tagging-expanded.gif
    :alt: app-tagging-expanded
    :align: center

|br|
If your dataset has sample or label tags, you can use the ``SAMPLE TAGS`` and
``LABEL TAGS`` sections of the filters sidebar to filter by your tags.

When you click the eye icon next to a sample tag, your view will update to only
include samples with the tag(s) you have selected. When you click the eye icon
next to a label tag, your view will update to only include labels with tag(s)
you have selected, and any samples with no matches will be automatically
excluded.

.. note::

    Did you know? When you have applied filter(s) in the App, a save icon
    appears in the top-left corner of the sample grid. Clicking this button
    will convert your filters to an equivalent set of stage(s) in the
    :ref:`view bar <app-create-view>`!

.. _app-object-patches:

Viewing object patches
______________________

Whenever you load a dataset in the App that contains label list fields in
|Detections| or |Polylines| format, you can use the patches menu to create a
view into your data that contains one sample per object patch in a specified
label field of your dataset.

To switch to patches view, simply click the patches icon above the sample grid
in the App, toggle to the ``Labels`` submenu, and then choose the field whose
object patches you want to view. After you make a selection, a new |ToPatches|
view stage will be appended to the view bar and your view will be updated to
show the patches.

By default, patches are cropped so only the label patch is visible, but you can
zoom in/out and pan as desired in the
:ref:`image visualizer <app-image-visualizer>`. If you would like to see the
entire image for each patch by default, click on the settings icon and uncheck
the `Crop to patch` setting. The setting is available in both the grid and
expanded sample view.

.. note::

    Switching to patches view will create patches for **only** the contents of
    your current view, so you can use the view bar and the filters sidebar to
    select only the content of interest prior to extracting patches.

.. image:: /images/app/app-object-patches.gif
    :alt: object-patches
    :align: center

|br|
You can interact with object patches views in the App just like you would with
any other view, including:

-   You can filter and transform objects patches views using the filter
    sidebar or the view bar
-   Any modifications to patch label tags that you make via the
    :ref:`tagging menu <app-tagging>` will be reflected on the source dataset

One notable exception is that tagging or untagging patches themselves (as
opposed to their labels) will not affect the sample tags of the underlying
|Sample|.

.. note::

    Did you know? You can construct object patches views programmatically
    via :ref:`dataset views <object-patches-views>`!

.. _app-evaluation-patches:

Viewing evaluation patches
__________________________

Whenever you load a dataset in the App that contains object detections on which
you have :ref:`run evaluation <evaluating-detections>`, you can use the patches
menu to create a view into your data that contains one sample for each true
positive, false positive, and false negative example.

To switch to evaluation patches view, simply click the patches icon above the
sample grid in the App, toggle to the ``Evaluations`` submenu, and then choose
the ``eval_key`` under which you saved the evaluation results that you want
view. After you make a selection, a new |ToEvaluationPatches| view stage will
be appended to the view bar and your view will be updated to show the
evaluation patches!

By default, evaluation patches are cropped so only the label(s) that make up
the patch are visible, but you can zoom in/out and pan as desired in the
:ref:`image visualizer <app-image-visualizer>`. If you would like to see the
entire image for each patch by default, click on the settings icon and uncheck
the `Crop to patch` setting. The setting is available in both the grid and
expanded sample view.

.. note::

    Refer to the :ref:`evaluation guide <evaluating-detections>` guide for more
    information about running evaluations and using evaluation patches views
    to analyze object detection models.

.. image:: /images/app/app-evaluation-patches.gif
    :alt: evaluation-patches
    :align: center

|br|
You can interact with evaluation patches views in the App just like you would
with any other view, including:

-   You can filter and transform evaluation patches views using the filter
    sidebar or the view bar
-   Any modifications to the tags of the ground truth or predicted labels that
    you make via the :ref:`tagging menu <app-tagging>` will be reflected on the
    source dataset

One notable exception is that tagging or untagging patches themselves (as
opposed to their labels) will not affect the sample tags of the underlying
|Sample|.

.. note::

    Switching to evaluation patches view will generate patches for **only**
    the contents of the current view, which may differ from the view on which
    the ``eval_key`` evaluation was performed. This may exclude some labels
    that were evaluated and/or include labels that were not evaluated.

    If you would like to see patches for the exact view on which an
    evaluation was performed, first call
    :meth:`load_evaluation_view() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_evaluation_view>`
    to load the view and then convert to patches.

.. _app-video-clips:

Viewing video clips
___________________

Whenever you load a video dataset in the App that contains |TemporalDetection|
labels or frame-level label lists such as |Detections|, you can use the patches
menu to create a view into your data that contains one sample per clip defined
by a specified label field of your dataset.

To switch to clips view, simply click the patches icon above the sample grid
in the App, toggle to the ``Labels`` submenu, and then choose the field whose
clips you want to view. After you make a selection, a new |ToClips| view stage
will be appended to the view bar and your view will be updated to show the
clips.

Creating a clips view for a |TemporalDetection| or |TemporalDetections| field
will create one sample per temporal detection defined by its `[first, last]`
frame support:

.. image:: /images/app/app-clip-views1.gif
    :alt: clip-views
    :align: center

|br|
Creating a clips view for a frame-level label list field such as |Detections|
will contain one sample per contiguous range of frames that contains at least
one label in the specified field:

.. image:: /images/app/app-clip-views2.gif
    :alt: clip-views
    :align: center

.. note::

    Switching to clips view will create clips for **only** the contents of
    your current view, so you can use the view bar and the filters sidebar to
    select only the content of interest prior to extracting clips.

    See :ref:`this section <clip-views>` for more information about defining
    clip views.

When you hover over a clip in the grid view, the clip and its labels will play
on loop. Similarly, when you open a clip in the
:ref:`video visualizer <app-video-visualizer>`, you will see only the clip when
you play the video. If you would like to see other segments of the video from
which a clip was extracted, simply drag the video scrubber outside the range of
the clip.

You can interact with clip views in the App just like you would with any other
view, including:

-   You can filter and transform clip views using the filter sidebar or the
    view bar
-   Any modifications to label tags that you make via the
    :ref:`tagging menu <app-tagging>` will be reflected on the source dataset

One notable exception is that tagging or untagging clips themselves (as opposed
to their labels) will not affect the sample tags of the underlying |Sample|.

.. note::

    Did you know? You can construct clip views programmatically via
    :ref:`dataset views <clip-views>`!

.. _app-similarity:

Sorting by similarity
_____________________

Whenever you select samples, patches, or labels in the App in a |Dataset| that
has been :ref:`indexed by similarity <brain-similarity>`, you can use the
similarity menu in the App to sort or filter your current view based on
similarity to the chosen image or object.

.. note::

    Refer to the :ref:`Brain guide <brain-similarity>` for more information
    about indexing datasets by image/object similarity for use with this
    feature.

.. _app-image-similarity:

Image similarity
----------------

Whenever one or more images are selected in the App, the similarity menu icon
appears above the grid. If you have indexed the dataset by
:ref:`image similarity <brain-image-similarity>`, then you will be able to sort
by similarity to your current selection.

You can use the advanced settings menu to choose between multiple brain keys
and optionally specify a maximum number of matches to return (`k`) and whether
to query by greatest or least similarity (if supported).

.. image:: /images/brain/brain-image-similarity.gif
    :alt: image-similarity
    :align: center

.. note::

    For large datasets, you may notice longer load times the first time you use
    a similarity index in a session. Subsequent similarity searches will use
    cached results and will be faster!

.. _app-object-similarity:

Object similarity
-----------------

Whenever one or more labels or patches are selected in the App, the similarity
menu icon appears above the sample grid. If you have indexed the dataset by
:ref:`object similarity <brain-object-similarity>`, then you will be able to
sort by similarity to your current selection.

The typical workflow for object similarity is to first switch to
:ref:`object patches view <app-object-patches>` for the label field of
interest. In this view, the similarity menu icon will appear whenever you have
selected one or more patches from the grid, and the resulting view will sort
the patches according to the similarity of their objects with respect to the
objects in the query patches.

You can use the advanced settings menu to choose between multiple brain keys
and optionally specify a maximum number of matches to return (`k`) and whether
to query by greatest or least similarity (if supported).

.. image:: /images/brain/brain-object-similarity.gif
    :alt: object-similarity
    :align: center

|br|
You can also sort by similarity to an object from the expanded sample view in
the App by selecting an object and then using the similarity menu that appears
in the upper-right corner of the modal:

.. image:: /images/brain/brain-object-similarity-modal.gif
    :alt: object-similarity-modal
    :align: center

.. note::

    For large datasets, you may notice longer load times the first time you use
    a similarity index in a session. Subsequent similarity searches will use
    cached results and will be faster!

.. _app-text-similarity:

Text similarity
---------------

If you have indexed your dataset with a model that
:ref:`supports text queries <brain-similarity-text>`, you can use the text
similarity menu in the App to search for images (or object patches) of interest
via arbitrary text queries!

You can use the advanced settings menu to choose between multiple brain keys
and optionally specify a maximum number of matches to return (`k`) and whether
to query by greatest or least similarity (if supported).

.. image:: /images/brain/brain-text-similarity.gif
   :alt: text-similarity
   :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? You can also perform text queries
    :ref:`via the SDK <brain-similarity-text>` by passing a prompt directly to
    :meth:`sort_by_similarity() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity>`!

.. _app-multiple-media-fields:

Multiple media fields
_____________________

There are use cases where you may want to associate multiple media versions
with each sample in your dataset, such as:

-   Thumbnail images
-   Anonymized (e.g., blurred) versions of the images

You can work with multiple media sources in FiftyOne by simply adding extra
field(s) to your dataset containing the paths to each media source and then
configuring your dataset to expose these multiple media fields in the App.

For example, let's create thumbnail images for use in the App's grid view and
store their paths in a `thumbnail_path` field:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.utils.image as foui
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # Generate some thumbnail images
    foui.transform_images(
        dataset,
        size=(-1, 32),
        output_field="thumbnail_path",
        output_dir="/tmp/thumbnails",
    )

    print(dataset)

.. code-block:: text

    Name:        quickstart
    Media type:  image
    Num samples: 200
    Persistent:  False
    Tags:        []
    Sample fields:
        id:               fiftyone.core.fields.ObjectIdField
        filepath:         fiftyone.core.fields.StringField
        tags:             fiftyone.core.fields.ListField(fiftyone.core.fields.StringField)
        metadata:         fiftyone.core.fields.EmbeddedDocumentField(fiftyone.core.metadata.ImageMetadata)
        created_at:       fiftyone.core.fields.DateTimeField
        last_modified_at: fiftyone.core.fields.DateTimeField
        ground_truth:     fiftyone.core.fields.EmbeddedDocumentField(fiftyone.core.labels.Detections)
        uniqueness:       fiftyone.core.fields.FloatField
        predictions:      fiftyone.core.fields.EmbeddedDocumentField(fiftyone.core.labels.Detections)
        thumbnail_path:   fiftyone.core.fields.StringField

We can expose the thumbnail images to the App by modifying the
:ref:`dataset's App config <dataset-app-config>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Modify the dataset's App config
    dataset.app_config.media_fields = ["filepath", "thumbnail_path"]
    dataset.app_config.grid_media_field = "thumbnail_path"
    dataset.save()  # must save after edits

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

Adding `thumbnail_path` to the
:class:`media_fields <fiftyone.core.odm.dataset.DatasetAppConfig>` property
adds it to the `Media Field` selector under the App's settings menu, and
setting the
:meth:`grid_media_field <fiftyone.core.odm.dataset.DatasetAppConfig>` property
to `thumbnail_path` instructs the App to use the thumbnail images by default in
the grid view:

.. image:: /images/app/app-multiple-media-fields.gif
    :alt: multiple-media-fields
    :align: center

.. warning::

    When populating multiple media fields on samples, keep in mind that all
    media sources must have the same **type** (e.g., image) and
    **aspect ratio** as the sample's primary `filepath`, since the media must
    be compatible with the dataset's spatial labels (e.g., object detections).

.. _app-config:

Configuring the App
___________________

The App's behavior can be configured on a per-session, per-dataset, or global
basis.

The order of precedence is:

1.  Any changes that you make to the
    :meth:`session.config <fiftyone.core.session.Session.config>` of a live
    session
2.  Any settings stored in a dataset's
    :meth:`app_config <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.app_config>`
3.  Settings from your :ref:`global App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`

Any settings or changes made at higher levels of precedence will override any
lower priority settings the next time you load/refresh the App.

Global App config
-----------------

FiftyOne provides a :ref:`global App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>` that
you can use to customize the default App behavior for all sessions and datasets
on your machine.

You can also customize the global App config on a per-session basis:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # Your default App config
    print(fo.app_config)

    # Create a custom App config
    app_config = fo.app_config.copy()
    app_config.show_confidence = False
    app_config.show_label = True
    print(app_config)

    # Launch App with custom config
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset, config=app_config)
    print(session.config)

Modifying your session
----------------------

You can configure a live |Session| by editing its
:meth:`session.config <fiftyone.core.session.Session.config>` property and
calling :meth:`session.refresh() <fiftyone.core.session.Session.refresh>` to
apply the changes:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    print(session.config)

    # Customize the config of a live session
    session.config.show_confidence = True
    session.config.show_label = True
    session.refresh()  # must refresh after edits

Dataset App config
------------------

Datasets also provide an :ref:`app_config property <dataset-app-config>` that
you can use to customize the behavior of the App for that particular dataset:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.utils.image as foui
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # View the dataset's current App config
    print(dataset.app_config)

    # Generate some thumbnail images
    foui.transform_images(
        dataset,
        size=(-1, 32),
        output_field="thumbnail_path",
        output_dir="/tmp/thumbnails",
    )

    # Modify the dataset's App config
    dataset.app_config.media_fields = ["filepath", "thumbnail_path"]
    dataset.app_config.grid_media_field = "thumbnail_path"
    dataset.save()  # must save after edits

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

.. note::

    Any settings stored in a dataset's
    :meth:`app_config <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.app_config>` will override
    the corresponding settings from your
    :ref:`global App config <configuring-fiftyone-app>`.
