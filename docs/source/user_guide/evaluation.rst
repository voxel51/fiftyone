Evaluating Models
=================

.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne provides a variety of builtin methods for evaluating your model
predictions, including regressions, classifications, detections, polygons,
instance and semantic segmentations, on both image and video datasets.

When you evaluate a model in FiftyOne, you get access to the standard aggregate
metrics such as classification reports, confusion matrices, and PR curves
for your model. In addition, FiftyOne can also record fine-grained statistics
like accuracy and false positive counts at the sample-level, which you can
leverage via :ref:`dataset views <using-views>` and the
:ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` to interactively explore the strengths and
weaknesses of your models on individual data samples.

Sample-level analysis often leads to critical insights that will help you
improve your datasets and models. For example, viewing the samples with the
most false positive predictions can reveal errors in your annotation schema.
Or, viewing the cluster of samples with the lowest accuracy can reveal gaps in
your training dataset that you need to address in order to improve your model's
performance. A key goal of FiftyOne is to help you uncover these insights on
your data!

.. note::

     Check out the :ref:`tutorials page <tutorials>` for in-depth walkthroughs
     of evaluating various types of models with FiftyOne.

Overview
________

FiftyOne's evaluation methods are conveniently exposed as methods on all
|Dataset| and |DatasetView| objects, which means that you can evaluate entire
datasets or specific views into them via the same syntax.

Let's illustrate the basic workflow by loading the
:ref:`quickstart dataset <dataset-zoo-quickstart>` and analyzing the object
detections in its `predictions` field using the
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
method:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the objects in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # objects in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval_predictions",
    )

Aggregate metrics
-----------------

Running an evaluation returns an instance of a task-specific subclass of
|EvaluationResults| that provides a handful of methods for generating aggregate
statistics about your dataset.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Get the 10 most common classes in the dataset
    counts = dataset.count_values("ground_truth.detections.label")
    classes = sorted(counts, key=counts.get, reverse=True)[:10]

    # Print a classification report for the top-10 classes
    results.print_report(classes=classes)

     weighted avg       0.42      0.68      0.51      1311

Sample metrics
--------------

In addition to standard aggregate metrics, when you pass an ``eval_key``
parameter to the evaluation routine, FiftyOne will populate helpful
task-specific information about your model's predictions on each sample, such
as false negative/positive counts and per-sample accuracies.

Continuing with our example, let's use :ref:`dataset views <using-views>` and
the :ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` to leverage these sample metrics to
investigate the samples with the most false positive predictions in the
dataset:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    # Create a view that has samples with the most false positives first, and
    # only includes false positive boxes in the `predictions` field
    view = (
        dataset
        .sort_by("eval_predictions_fp", reverse=True)
        .filter_labels("predictions", F("eval_predictions") == "fp")
    )

    # Visualize results in the App
    session = fo.launch_app(view=view)

.. image:: /images/evaluation/quickstart_evaluate_detections.gif
   :alt: quickstart-evaluate-detections
   :align: center

|br|
Notice anything wrong? The sample with the most false positives is a plate of
carrots where the entire plate has been boxed as a single example in the ground
truth while the model is generating predictions for individual carrots!

If you're familiar with `COCO format <https://cocodataset.org/#format-data>`_
(which is recognized by
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
by default), you'll notice that the issue here is that the ``iscrowd``
attribute of this ground truth annotation has been incorrectly set to ``0``.
Resolving mistakes like these will provide a much more accurate picture of the
real performance of a model.

.. _confusion-matrices:

Confusion matrices
------------------

When you use evaluation methods such as
:meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`
and
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
to evaluate model predictions, the confusion matrices that you can generate
by calling the
:meth:`plot_confusion_matrix() <fiftyone.utils.eval.classification.ClassificationResults.plot_confusion_matrix>`
method are responsive plots that can be attached to App instances to
interactively explore specific cases of your model's performance.

.. note::

    See :ref:`this section <confusion-matrix-plots>` for more information about
    interactive confusion matrices in FiftyOne.

Continuing with our example, the code block below generates a confusion matrix
for our evaluation results and :ref:`attaches it to the App <attaching-plots>`.

In this setup, you can click on individual cells of the confusion matrix to
select the corresponding ground truth and/or predicted objects in the App. For
example, if you click on a diagonal cell of the confusion matrix, you will
see the true positive examples of that class in the App.

Likewise, whenever you modify the Session's view, either in the App or by
programmatically setting
:meth:`session.view <fiftyone.core.session.Session.view>`, the confusion matrix
is automatically updated to show the cell counts for only those objects that
are included in the current view.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Plot confusion matrix
    plot = results.plot_confusion_matrix(classes=classes)
    plot.show()

    # Connect to session
    session.plots.attach(plot)

.. image:: /images/plots/detection-evaluation.gif
   :alt: detection-evaluation
   :align: center

.. _managing-evaluations:

Managing evaluations
--------------------

When you run an evaluation with an ``eval_key`` argument, the evaluation is
recorded on the dataset and you can retrieve information about it later, rename
it, delete it (along with any modifications to your dataset that were performed
by it), and :ref:`retrieve the view <load-evaluation-view>` that you evaluated
on using the following methods on your dataset:

-   :meth:`list_evaluations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_evaluations>`
-   :meth:`get_evaluation_info() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_evaluation_info>`
-   :meth:`load_evaluation_results() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_evaluation_results>`
-   :meth:`load_evaluation_view() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_evaluation_view>`
-   :meth:`rename_evaluation() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_evaluation>`
-   :meth:`delete_evaluation() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_evaluation>`

The example below demonstrates the basic interface:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # List evaluations you've run on a dataset
    dataset.list_evaluations()
    # ['eval_predictions']

    # Print information about an evaluation
    print(dataset.get_evaluation_info("eval_predictions"))

    # Load existing evaluation results and use them
    results = dataset.load_evaluation_results("eval_predictions")
    results.print_report()

    # Rename the evaluation
    # This will automatically rename any evaluation fields on your dataset
    dataset.rename_evaluation("eval_predictions", "eval")

    # Delete the evaluation
    # This will remove any evaluation data that was populated on your dataset
    dataset.delete_evaluation("eval")

The sections below discuss evaluating various types of predictions in more
detail.

.. _evaluating-regressions:

Regressions
___________

You can use the
:meth:`evaluate_regressions() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_regressions>`
method to evaluate the predictions of a regression model stored in a
|Regression| field of your dataset.

Invoking
:meth:`evaluate_regressions() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_regressions>`
returns a |RegressionResults| instance that provides a variety of methods for
evaluating your model.

In addition, when you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, helpful fields will be
populated on each sample that you can leverage via the
:ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` to interactively explore the strengths and
weaknesses of your model on individual samples.

Simple evaluation (default)
---------------------------

By default,
:meth:`evaluate_regressions() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_regressions>`
will evaluate each prediction by directly comparing its ``value`` to the
associated ground truth value.

You can explicitly request that simple evaluation be used by setting the
``method`` parameter to ``"simple"``.

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a float ``eval_key`` field will be
populated on each sample that records the error of that sample's prediction
with respect to its ground truth value. By default, the squared error will be
computed, but you can customize this via the optional ``metric`` argument to
:meth:`evaluate_regressions() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_regressions>`,
which can take any value supported by
:class:`SimpleEvaluationConfig <fiftyone.utils.eval.regression.SimpleEvaluationConfig>`.

The example below demonstrates simple evaluation on the
:ref:`quickstart dataset <dataset-zoo-quickstart>` with some fake regression
data added to it to demonstrate the workflow:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import random
    import numpy as np

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart").select_fields().clone()

    # Populate some fake regression + weather data
    for idx, sample in enumerate(dataset, 1):
        ytrue = random.random() * idx
        ypred = ytrue + np.random.randn() * np.sqrt(ytrue)
        confidence = random.random()
        sample["ground_truth"] = fo.Regression(value=ytrue)
        sample["predictions"] = fo.Regression(value=ypred, confidence=confidence)
        sample["weather"] = random.choice(["sunny", "cloudy", "rainy"])
        sample.save()

    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the predictions in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # values in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_regressions(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval",
    )

    # Print some standard regression evaluation metrics
    results.print_metrics()

    # Plot a scatterplot of the results colored by `weather` and scaled by
    # `confidence`
    plot = results.plot_results(labels="weather", sizes="predictions.confidence")
    plot.show()

    # Launch the App to explore
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

    # Show the samples with the smallest regression error
    session.view = dataset.sort_by("eval")

    # Show the samples with the largest regression error
    session.view = dataset.sort_by("eval", reverse=True)

.. code-block:: text

    mean squared error        59.69
    root mean squared error   7.73
    mean absolute error       5.48
    median absolute error     3.57
    r2 score                  0.97
    explained variance score  0.97
    max error                 31.77
    support                   200

.. image:: /images/evaluation/regression_evaluation_plot.png
   :alt: regression-evaluation-plot
   :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? You can
    :ref:`attach regression plots to the App <regression-plots>` and
    interactively explore them by selecting scatter points and/or modifying
    your view in the App.

.. _evaluating-classifications:

Classifications
_______________

You can use the
:meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`
method to evaluate the predictions of a classifier stored in a
|Classification| field of your dataset.

By default, the classifications will be treated as a generic multiclass
classification task, but you can specify other evaluation strategies such as
top-k accuracy or binary evaluation via the ``method`` parameter.

Invoking
:meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`
returns a |ClassificationResults| instance that provides a variety of methods
for generating various aggregate evaluation reports about your model.

In addition, when you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a number of helpful
fields will be populated on each sample that you can leverage via the
:ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` to interactively explore the strengths and
weaknesses of your model on individual samples.

Simple evaluation (default)
---------------------------

By default,
:meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`
will treat your classifications as generic multiclass predictions, and it will
evaluate each prediction by directly comparing its ``label`` to the associated
ground truth prediction.

You can explicitly request that simple evaluation be used by setting the
``method`` parameter to ``"simple"``.

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a boolean ``eval_key`` field will
be populated on each sample that records whether that sample's prediction is
correct.

The example below demonstrates simple evaluation on the
:ref:`CIFAR-10 dataset <dataset-zoo-cifar10>` with some fake predictions added
to it to demonstrate the workflow:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import random

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "cifar10",
        split="test",
        max_samples=1000,
        shuffle=True,
    )

    #
    # Create some test predictions by copying the ground truth labels into a
    # new `predictions` field with 10% of the labels perturbed at random
    #

    classes = dataset.distinct("ground_truth.label")

    def jitter(val):
        if random.random() < 0.10:
            return random.choice(classes)

        return val

    predictions = [
        fo.Classification(label=jitter(gt.label), confidence=random.random())
        for gt in dataset.values("ground_truth")
    ]

    dataset.set_values("predictions", predictions)

    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the predictions in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # labels in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_classifications(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval_simple",
    )

    # Print a classification report
    results.print_report()

    # Plot a confusion matrix
    plot = results.plot_confusion_matrix()
    plot.show()

    # Launch the App to explore
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

    # View only the incorrect predictions in the App
    session.view = dataset.match(F("eval_simple") == False)

.. note::

    Did you know? You can
    :ref:`attach confusion matrices to the App <confusion-matrix-plots>` and
    interactively explore them by clicking on their cells and/or modifying your
    view in the App.

Top-k evaluation
----------------

Set the ``method`` parameter of
:meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`
to ``top-k`` in order to use top-k matching to evaluate your classifications.

Under this strategy, predictions are deemed to be correct if the corresponding
ground truth label is within the top ``k`` predictions.

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a boolean ``eval_key`` field will
be populated on each sample that records whether that sample's prediction is
correct.

.. note::

    In order to use top-k evaluation, you must populate the ``logits`` field
    of your predictions, and you must provide the list of corresponding class
    labels via the ``classes`` parameter of
    :meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`.

    Did you know? Many models from the :ref:`Model Zoo <model-zoo>`
    provide support for storing logits for their predictions!

The example below demonstrates top-k evaluation on a
:ref:`small ImageNet sample <dataset-zoo-imagenet-sample>` with predictions
from a pre-trained model from the :ref:`Model Zoo <model-zoo>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "imagenet-sample", dataset_name="top-k-eval-demo"
    )

    # We need the list of class labels corresponding to the logits
    logits_classes = dataset.default_classes

    # Add predictions (with logits) to 25 random samples
    predictions_view = dataset.take(25, seed=51)
    model = foz.load_zoo_model("resnet50-imagenet-torch")
    predictions_view.apply_model(model, "predictions", store_logits=True)

    print(predictions_view)

    # Evaluate the predictions in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # labels in the `ground_truth` field using top-5 accuracy
    results = predictions_view.evaluate_classifications(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval_top_k",
        method="top-k",
        classes=logits_classes,
        k=5,
    )

    # Get the 10 most common classes in the view
    counts = predictions_view.count_values("ground_truth.label")
    classes = sorted(counts, key=counts.get, reverse=True)[:10]

    # Print a classification report for the top-10 classes
    results.print_report(classes=classes)

    # Launch the App to explore
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

    # View only the incorrect predictions for the 10 most common classes
    session.view = (
        predictions_view
        .match(F("ground_truth.label").is_in(classes))
        .match(F("eval_top_k") == False)
    )

.. image:: /images/evaluation/imagenet_top_k_eval.png
   :alt: imagenet-top-k-eval
   :align: center

Binary evaluation
-----------------

If your classifier is binary, set the ``method`` parameter of
:meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`
to ``"binary"`` in order to access binary-specific evaluation information such
as precision-recall curves for your model.

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a string ``eval_key`` field will
be populated on each sample that records whether the sample is a true positive,
false positive, true negative, or false negative.

.. note::

    In order to use binary evaluation, you must provide the
    ``(neg_label, pos_label)`` for your model via the ``classes`` parameter of
    :meth:`evaluate_classifications() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_classifications>`.

The example below demonstrates binary evaluation on the
:ref:`CIFAR-10 dataset <dataset-zoo-cifar10>` with some fake binary predictions
added to it to demonstrate the workflow:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import random

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    # Load a small sample from the ImageNet dataset
    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "cifar10",
        split="test",
        max_samples=1000,
        shuffle=True,
    )

    #
    # Binarize the ground truth labels to `cat` and `other`, and add
    # predictions that are correct proportionally to their confidence
    #

    classes = ["other", "cat"]

    for sample in dataset:
        gt_label = "cat" if sample.ground_truth.label == "cat" else "other"

        confidence = random.random()
        if random.random() > confidence:
            pred_label = "cat" if gt_label == "other" else "other"
        else:
            pred_label = gt_label

        sample.ground_truth.label = gt_label
        sample["predictions"] = fo.Classification(
            label=pred_label, confidence=confidence
        )

        sample.save()

    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the predictions in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # labels in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_classifications(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval_binary",
        method="binary",
        classes=classes,
    )

.. _evaluating-detections:

Detections
__________

You can use the
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
method to evaluate the predictions of an object detection model stored in a
|Detections|, |Polylines|, or |Keypoints| field of your dataset or of a
temporal detection model stored in a |TemporalDetections| field of your
dataset.

Invoking
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
returns a |DetectionResults| instance that provides a variety of methods for
generating various aggregate evaluation reports about your model.

In addition, when you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a number of helpful
fields will be populated on each sample and its predicted/ground truth
objects that you can leverage via the :ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` to
interactively explore the strengths and weaknesses of your model on individual
samples.

.. note::

    FiftyOne uses the :ref:`COCO-style <evaluating-detections-coco>` evaluation
    by default, but
    :ref:`Open Images-style <evaluating-detections-open-images>` evaluation is
    also natively supported.

.. _evaluation-detection-types:

Supported types
---------------

The :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
method supports all of the following task types:

-   :ref:`Object detection <object-detection>`
-   :ref:`Instance segmentations <instance-segmentation>`
-   :ref:`Polygon detection <polylines>`
-   :ref:`Keypoints <keypoints>`
-   :ref:`Temporal detections <temporal-detection>`
-   :ref:`3D detections <3d-detections>`

The only difference between each task type is in how the IoU between objects is
calculated:

-   For object detections, IoUs are computed between each pair of bounding boxes
-   For instance segmentations and polygons, IoUs are computed between the
    polgyonal shapes rather than their rectangular bounding boxes
-   For keypoint tasks,
    `object keypoint similarity <https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval>`_
    is computed for each pair of objects, using the extent of the ground truth
    keypoints as a proxy for the area of the object's bounding box, and
    assuming uniform falloff (:math:`\kappa`)
-   For temporal detections, IoU is computed between the 1D support of two
    temporal segments

For object detection tasks, the ground truth and predicted objects should be
stored in |Detections| format.

For instance segmentation tasks, the ground truth and predicted objects should
be stored in |Detections| format, and each |Detection| instance should have its
:attr:`mask <fiftyone.core.labels.Detection.mask>` attribute populated to
define the extent of the object within its bounding box.

.. note::

    In order to use instance masks for IoU calculations, pass ``use_masks=True``
    to :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`.

For polygon detection tasks, the ground truth and predicted objects should be
stored in |Polylines| format with their
:attr:`filled <fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled>` attribute set to
``True`` to indicate that they represent closed polygons (as opposed to
polylines).

.. note::

    If you are evaluating polygons but would rather use bounding boxes rather
    than the actual polygonal geometries for IoU calculations, you can pass
    ``use_boxes=True`` to
    :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`.

For keypoint tasks, each |Keypoint| instance must contain point arrays of equal
length and semantic ordering.

.. note::

    If a particular point is missing or not visible for a |Keypoint| instance,
    use nan values for its coordinates. :ref:`See here <keypoints>` for more
    information about structuring keypoints.

For temporal detection tasks, the ground truth and predicted objects should be
stored in |TemporalDetections| format.

.. _evaluation-patches:

Evaluation patches views
------------------------

Once you have run
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
on a dataset, you can use
:meth:`to_evaluation_patches() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.to_evaluation_patches>`
to transform the dataset (or a view into it) into a new view that contains one
sample for each true positive, false positive, and false negative example.

True positive examples will result in samples with both their ground truth and
predicted fields populated, while false positive/negative examples will only
have one of their corresponding predicted/ground truth fields populated,
respectively.

If multiple predictions are matched to a ground truth object (e.g., if the
evaluation protocol includes a crowd attribute), then all matched predictions
will be stored in the single sample along with the ground truth object.

Evaluation patches views also have top-level ``type`` and ``iou`` fields
populated based on the evaluation results for that example, as well as a
``sample_id`` field recording the sample ID of the example, and a ``crowd``
field if the evaluation protocol defines a crowd attribute.

.. note::

    Evaluation patches views generate patches for **only** the contents of the
    current view, which may differ from the view on which the ``eval_key``
    evaluation was performed. This may exclude some labels that were evaluated
    and/or include labels that were not evaluated.

    If you would like to see patches for the exact view on which an
    evaluation was performed, first call
    :meth:`load_evaluation_view() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_evaluation_view>`
    to load the view and then convert to patches.

The example below demonstrates loading an evaluation patches view for the
results of an evaluation on the
:ref:`quickstart dataset <dataset-zoo-quickstart>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # Evaluate `predictions` w.r.t. labels in `ground_truth` field
    dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions", gt_field="ground_truth", eval_key="eval"
    )

    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

    # Convert to evaluation patches
    eval_patches = dataset.to_evaluation_patches("eval")
    print(eval_patches)

    print(eval_patches.count_values("type"))
    # {'fn': 246, 'fp': 4131, 'tp': 986}

    # View patches in the App
    session.view = eval_patches

.. code-block:: text

    Dataset:     quickstart
    Media type:  image
    Num patches: 5363
    Patch fields:
        filepath:     fiftyone.core.fields.StringField
        tags:         fiftyone.core.fields.ListField(fiftyone.core.fields.StringField)
        metadata:     fiftyone.core.fields.EmbeddedDocumentField(fiftyone.core.metadata.ImageMetadata)
        predictions:  fiftyone.core.fields.EmbeddedDocumentField(fiftyone.core.labels.Detections)
        ground_truth: fiftyone.core.fields.EmbeddedDocumentField(fiftyone.core.labels.Detections)
        sample_id:    fiftyone.core.fields.StringField
        type:         fiftyone.core.fields.StringField
        iou:          fiftyone.core.fields.FloatField
        crowd:        fiftyone.core.fields.BooleanField
    View stages:
        1. ToEvaluationPatches(eval_key='eval', config=None)

.. note::

    Did you know? You can convert to evaluation patches view directly
    :ref:`from the App <app-evaluation-patches>`!

.. image:: /images/evaluation/evaluation_patches.gif
    :alt: evaluation-patches
    :align: center

|br|
Evaluation patches views are just like any other
:ref:`dataset view <using-views>` in the sense that:

-   You can append view stages via the :ref:`App view bar <app-create-view>` or
    :ref:`views API <using-views>`
-   Any modifications to ground truth or predicted label tags that you make via
    the App's :ref:`tagging menu <app-tagging>` or via API methods like
    :meth:`tag_labels() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.tag_labels>`
    and :meth:`untag_labels() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.untag_labels>`
    will be reflected on the source dataset
-   Any modifications to the predicted or ground truth |Label| elements in the
    patches view that you make by iterating over the contents of the view or
    calling
    :meth:`set_values() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.set_values>`
    will be reflected on the source dataset
-   Calling :meth:`save() <fiftyone.core.patches.EvaluationPatchesView.save>`
    on an evaluation patches view (typically one that contains additional view
    stages that filter or modify its contents) will sync any |Label| edits or
    deletions with the source dataset

However, because evaluation patches views only contain a subset of the contents
of a |Sample| from the source dataset, there are some differences in behavior
compared to non-patch views:

-   Tagging or untagging patches themselves (as opposed to their labels) will
    not affect the tags of the underlying |Sample|
-   Any new fields that you add to an evaluation patches view will not be added
    to the source dataset

.. _evaluating-detections-coco:

COCO-style evaluation (default spatial)
---------------------------------------

By default,
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
will use `COCO-style evaluation <https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval>`_ to
analyze predictions when the specified label fields are |Detections| or
|Polylines|.

You can also explicitly request that COCO-style evaluation be used by setting
the ``method`` parameter to ``"coco"``.

.. note::

    FiftyOne's implementation of COCO-style evaluation matches the reference
    implementation available via
    `pycocotools <https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi>`_.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

When running COCO-style evaluation using
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`:

-   Predicted and ground truth objects are matched using a specified IoU
    threshold (default = 0.50). This threshold can be customized via the
    ``iou`` parameter

-   By default, only objects with the same ``label`` will be matched. Classwise
    matching can be disabled via the ``classwise`` parameter

-   Ground truth objects can have an ``iscrowd`` attribute that indicates
    whether the annotation contains a crowd of objects. Multiple predictions
    can be matched to crowd ground truth objects. The name of this attribute
    can be customized by passing the optional ``iscrowd`` attribute of
    |COCOEvaluationConfig| to
    :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a number of helpful fields will be
populated on each sample and its predicted/ground truth objects:

-   True positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) counts
    for the each sample are saved in top-level fields of each sample::

        TP: sample.<eval_key>_tp
        FP: sample.<eval_key>_fp
        FN: sample.<eval_key>_fn

-   The fields listed below are populated on each individual object instance;
    these fields tabulate the TP/FP/FN status of the object, the ID of the
    matching object (if any), and the matching IoU::

        TP/FP/FN: object.<eval_key>
              ID: object.<eval_key>_id
             IoU: object.<eval_key>_iou

.. note::

    See |COCOEvaluationConfig| for complete descriptions of the optional
    keyword arguments that you can pass to
    :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
    when running COCO-style evaluation.

Example evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example below demonstrates COCO-style detection evaluation on the
:ref:`quickstart dataset <dataset-zoo-quickstart>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the objects in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # objects in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval",
    )

    # Get the 10 most common classes in the dataset
    counts = dataset.count_values("ground_truth.detections.label")
    classes = sorted(counts, key=counts.get, reverse=True)[:10]

    # Print a classification report for the top-10 classes
    results.print_report(classes=classes)

    # Print some statistics about the total TP/FP/FN counts
    print("TP: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_tp"))
    print("FP: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_fp"))
    print("FN: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_fn"))

    # Create a view that has samples with the most false positives first, and
    # only includes false positive boxes in the `predictions` field
    view = (
        dataset
        .sort_by("eval_fp", reverse=True)
        .filter_labels("predictions", F("eval") == "fp")
    )

    # Visualize results in the App
    session = fo.launch_app(view=view)

   :align: center

mAP and PR curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compute mean average precision (mAP) and precision-recall (PR) curves
for your objects by passing the ``compute_mAP=True`` flag to
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`:

.. note::

    All mAP calculations are performed according to the
    `COCO evaluation protocol <https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval>`_.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    print(dataset)

    # Performs an IoU sweep so that mAP and PR curves can be computed
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        compute_mAP=True,
    )

    print(results.mAP())
    # 0.3957

    plot = results.plot_pr_curves(classes=["person", "kite", "car"])
    plot.show()

.. image:: /images/evaluation/coco_pr_curves.png
   :alt: coco-pr-curves
   :align: center

Confusion matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also easily generate :ref:`confusion matrices <confusion-matrices>` for
the results of COCO-style evaluations.

In order for the confusion matrix to capture anything other than false
positive/negative counts, you will likely want to set the
:class:`classwise <fiftyone.utils.eval.coco.COCOEvaluationConfig>` parameter
to ``False`` during evaluation so that predicted objects can be matched with
ground truth objects of different classes.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # Perform evaluation, allowing objects to be matched between classes
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions", gt_field="ground_truth", classwise=False
    )

    # Generate a confusion matrix for the specified classes
    plot = results.plot_confusion_matrix(classes=["car", "truck", "motorcycle"])
    plot.show()

.. image:: /images/evaluation/coco_confusion_matrix.png
   :alt: coco-confusion-matrix
   :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? :ref:`Confusion matrices <confusion-matrices>` can be
    attached to your |Session| object and dynamically explored using FiftyOne's
    :ref:`interactive plotting features <confusion-matrix-plots>`!

.. _evaluating-detections-open-images:

Open Images-style evaluation
----------------------------

The :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
method also supports
`Open Images-style evaluation <https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/evaluation.html>`_.

In order to run Open Images-style evaluation, simply set the ``method``
parameter to ``"open-images"``.

.. note::

    FiftyOne's implementation of Open Images-style evaluation matches the
    reference implementation available via the
    `TF Object Detection API <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>`_.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Open Images-style evaluation provides additional features not found in
:ref:`COCO-style evaluation <evaluating-detections-coco>` that you may find
useful when evaluating your custom datasets.

The two primary differences are:

-   **Non-exhaustive image labeling:** positive and negative sample-level
    |Classifications| fields can be provided to indicate which object classes
    were considered when annotating the image. Predicted objects whose classes
    are not included in the sample-level labels for a sample are ignored.
    The names of these fields can be specified via the ``pos_label_field`` and
    ``neg_label_field`` parameters

-   **Class hierarchies:** If your dataset includes a
    `class hierarchy <https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/2018_04/bbox_labels_600_hierarchy_visualizer/circle.html>`_,
    you can configure this evaluation protocol to automatically expand ground
    truth and/or predicted leaf classes so that all levels of the hierarchy can
    be `correctly evaluated <https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/evaluation.html>`_.
    You can provide a label hierarchy via the ``hierarchy`` parameter. By
    default, if you provide a hierarchy, then image-level label fields and
    ground truth detections will be expanded to incorporate parent classes
    (child classes for negative image-level labels). You can disable this
    feature by setting the ``expand_gt_hierarchy`` parameter to ``False``.
    Alternatively, you can expand predictions by setting the
    ``expand_pred_hierarchy`` parameter to ``True``

In addition, note that:

-   Like `VOC-style evaluation <http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2010/devkit_doc_08-May-2010.pdf>`_,
    only one IoU (default = 0.5) is used to calculate mAP. You can customize
    this value via the ``iou`` parameter

-   When dealing with crowd objects, Open Images-style evaluation dictates that
    if a crowd is matched with multiple predictions, each counts as one true
    positive when computing mAP

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a number of helpful fields will be
populated on each sample and its predicted/ground truth objects:

-   True positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) counts
    for the each sample are saved in top-level fields of each sample::

        TP: sample.<eval_key>_tp
        FP: sample.<eval_key>_fp
        FN: sample.<eval_key>_fn

-   The fields listed below are populated on each individual |Detection|
    instance; these fields tabulate the TP/FP/FN status of the object, the ID
    of the matching object (if any), and the matching IoU::

        TP/FP/FN: object.<eval_key>
              ID: object.<eval_key>_id
             IoU: object.<eval_key>_iou

.. note::

    See |OpenImagesEvaluationConfig| for complete descriptions of the optional
    keyword arguments that you can pass to
    :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
    when running Open Images-style evaluation.

Example evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example below demonstrates Open Images-style detection evaluation on the
:ref:`quickstart dataset <dataset-zoo-quickstart>`:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the objects in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # objects in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        method="open-images",
        eval_key="eval",
    )

    # Get the 10 most common classes in the dataset
    counts = dataset.count_values("ground_truth.detections.label")
    classes = sorted(counts, key=counts.get, reverse=True)[:10]

    # Print a classification report for the top-10 classes
    results.print_report(classes=classes)

    # Print some statistics about the total TP/FP/FN counts
    print("TP: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_tp"))
    print("FP: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_fp"))
    print("FN: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_fn"))

    # Create a view that has samples with the most false positives first, and
    # only includes false positive boxes in the `predictions` field
    view = (
        dataset
        .sort_by("eval_fp", reverse=True)
        .filter_labels("predictions", F("eval") == "fp")
    )

mAP and PR curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily compute mean average precision (mAP) and precision-recall (PR)
curves using the results object returned by
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`:

.. note::

    FiftyOne's implementation of Open Images-style evaluation matches the
    reference implementation available via the
    `TF Object Detection API <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>`_.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
    print(dataset)

    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        method="open-images",
    )

    print(results.mAP())
    # 0.599

    plot = results.plot_pr_curves(classes=["person", "dog", "car"])
    plot.show()

.. image:: /images/evaluation/oi_pr_curve.png
   :alt: oi-pr-curve
   :align: center

Confusion matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also easily generate :ref:`confusion matrices <confusion-matrices>` for
the results of Open Images-style evaluations.

In order for the confusion matrix to capture anything other than false
positive/negative counts, you will likely want to set the
:class:`classwise <fiftyone.utils.eval.openimages.OpenImagesEvaluationConfig>`
parameter to ``False`` during evaluation so that predicted objects can be
matched with ground truth objects of different classes.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

    # Perform evaluation, allowing objects to be matched between classes
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        method="open-images",
        classwise=False,
    )

    # Generate a confusion matrix for the specified classes
    plot = results.plot_confusion_matrix(classes=["car", "truck", "motorcycle"])
    plot.show()

.. image:: /images/evaluation/oi_confusion_matrix.png
   :alt: oi-confusion-matrix
   :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? :ref:`Confusion matrices <confusion-matrices>` can be
    attached to your |Session| object and dynamically explored using FiftyOne's
    :ref:`interactive plotting features <confusion-matrix-plots>`!

.. _evaluating-detections-activitynet:

ActivityNet-style evaluation (default temporal)
-----------------------------------------------

By default,
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
will use 
`ActivityNet-style temporal detection evaluation <https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/tree/master/Evaluation>`_.
to analyze predictions when the specified label fields are |TemporalDetections|.

You can also explicitly request that ActivityNet-style evaluation be used by setting
the ``method`` parameter to ``"activitynet"``.

.. note::

    FiftyOne's implementation of ActivityNet-style evaluation matches the
    reference implementation available via the
    `ActivityNet API <https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/tree/master/Evaluation>`_.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

When running ActivityNet-style evaluation using
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`:

-   Predicted and ground truth segments are matched using a specified IoU
    threshold (default = 0.50). This threshold can be customized via the
    ``iou`` parameter

-   By default, only segments with the same ``label`` will be matched.
    Classwise matching can be disabled by passing ``classwise=False``

-   mAP is computed by averaging over the same range of IoU values
    :ref:`used by COCO <coco-map>`

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a number of helpful fields will be
populated on each sample and its predicted/ground truth segments:

-   True positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) counts
    for the each sample are saved in top-level fields of each sample::

        TP: sample.<eval_key>_tp
        FP: sample.<eval_key>_fp
        FN: sample.<eval_key>_fn

-   The fields listed below are populated on each individual temporal detection
    segment; these fields tabulate the TP/FP/FN status of the segment, the ID
    of the matching segment (if any), and the matching IoU::

        TP/FP/FN: segment.<eval_key>
              ID: segment.<eval_key>_id
             IoU: segment.<eval_key>_iou

.. note::

    See |ActivityNetEvaluationConfig| for complete descriptions of the optional
    keyword arguments that you can pass to
    :meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
    when running ActivityNet-style evaluation.

Example evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example below demonstrates ActivityNet-style temporal detection evaluation
on the :ref:`ActivityNet 200 dataset <dataset-zoo-activitynet-200>`:

        classes=classes,
        max_samples=10,
    )
    print(dataset)

    # Generate some fake predictions for this example
    random.seed(51)
    dataset.clone_sample_field("ground_truth", "predictions")
    for sample in dataset:
        for det in sample.predictions.detections:
            det.support[0] += random.randint(-10,10)
            det.support[1] += random.randint(-10,10)
            det.support[0] = max(det.support[0], 1)
            det.support[1] = max(det.support[1], det.support[0] + 1)
            det.confidence = random.random()
            det.label = random.choice(classes)

        sample.save()

    # Evaluate the segments in the `predictions` field with respect to the
    # segments in the `ground_truth` field
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval",
    )

    # Print a classification report for the classes
    results.print_report(classes=classes)

    # Print some statistics about the total TP/FP/FN counts
    print("TP: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_tp"))
    print("FP: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_fp"))
    print("FN: %d" % dataset.sum("eval_fn"))

    # Create a view that has samples with the most false positives first, and
    # only includes false positive segments in the `predictions` field
    view = (
        dataset
        .sort_by("eval_fp", reverse=True)
        .filter_labels("predictions", F("eval") == "fp")
    )

mAP and PR curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compute mean average precision (mAP) and precision-recall (PR) curves
for your segments by passing the ``compute_mAP=True`` flag to
:meth:`evaluate_detections() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`:

.. note::

    All mAP calculations are performed according to the
    `ActivityNet evaluation protocol <https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/tree/master/Evaluation>`_.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import random

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    # Load subset of ActivityNet 200
    classes = ["Bathing dog", "Walking the dog"]
    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "activitynet-200",
        split="validation",
        classes=classes,
        max_samples=10,
    )
    print(dataset)

    # Generate some fake predictions for this example
    random.seed(51)
    dataset.clone_sample_field("ground_truth", "predictions")
    for sample in dataset:
        for det in sample.predictions.detections:
            det.support[0] += random.randint(-10,10)
            det.support[1] += random.randint(-10,10)
            det.support[0] = max(det.support[0], 1)
            det.support[1] = max(det.support[1], det.support[0] + 1)
            det.confidence = random.random()
            det.label = random.choice(classes)

        sample.save()

    # Performs an IoU sweep so that mAP and PR curves can be computed
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval",
        compute_mAP=True,
    )

    print(results.mAP())
    # 0.367

    plot.show()

Confusion matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also easily generate :ref:`confusion matrices <confusion-matrices>` for
the results of ActivityNet-style evaluations.

In order for the confusion matrix to capture anything other than false
positive/negative counts, you will likely want to set the
:class:`classwise <fiftyone.utils.eval.coco.ActivityNetEvaluationConfig>`
parameter to ``False`` during evaluation so that predicted segments can be
matched with ground truth segments of different classes.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import random

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    classes = ["Bathing dog", "Grooming dog", "Grooming horse", "Walking the dog"]
    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(

        sample.save()

    # Perform evaluation, allowing objects to be matched between classes
    results = dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions", gt_field="ground_truth", classwise=False
    )

    # Generate a confusion matrix for the specified classes
    plot = results.plot_confusion_matrix(classes=classes)
    plot.show()

.. image:: /images/evaluation/activitynet_confusion_matrix.png
   :alt: activitynet-confusion-matrix
   :align: center

.. note::

    Did you know? :ref:`Confusion matrices <confusion-matrices>` can be
    attached to your |Session| object and dynamically explored using FiftyOne's
    :ref:`interactive plotting features <confusion-matrix-plots>`!

.. _evaluating-segmentations:

Semantic segmentations
______________________

You can use the
:meth:`evaluate_segmentations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_segmentations>`
method to evaluate the predictions of a semantic segmentation model stored in a
|Segmentation| field of your dataset.

By default, the full segmentation masks will be evaluated at a pixel level, but
you can specify other evaluation strategies such as evaluating only boundary
pixels (see below for details).

Invoking
:meth:`evaluate_segmentations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_segmentations>`
returns a |SegmentationResults| instance that provides a variety of methods for
generating various aggregate evaluation reports about your model.

In addition, when you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, a number of helpful
fields will be populated on each sample that you can leverage via the
:ref:`FiftyOne App <fiftyone-app>` to interactively explore the strengths and
weaknesses of your model on individual samples.

.. note::

    You can :ref:`store mask targets <storing-mask-targets>` for your
    |Segmentation| fields on your dataset so that you can view semantic labels
    in the App and avoid having to manually specify the set of mask targets
    each time you run
    :meth:`evaluate_segmentations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_segmentations>`
    on a dataset.

Simple evaluation (default)
---------------------------

By default,
:meth:`evaluate_segmentations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections>`
will perform pixelwise evaluation of the segmentation masks, treating each
pixel as a multiclass classification.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

-   If the size of a predicted mask does not match the ground truth mask, it is
    resized to match the ground truth.
-   You can specify the optional ``bandwidth`` parameter to evaluate only along
    the contours of the ground truth masks. By default, the entire masks are
    evaluated.

You can explicitly request that this strategy be used by setting the ``method``
parameter to ``"simple"``.

When you specify an ``eval_key`` parameter, the accuracy, precision, and recall
of each sample is recorded in top-level fields of each sample:

.. code-block:: text

     Accuracy: sample.<eval_key>_accuracy
    Precision: sample.<eval_key>_precision
       Recall: sample.<eval_key>_recall

.. note::

    The mask values ``0`` and ``#000000`` are treated as a background class
    for the purposes of computing evaluation metrics like precision and
    recall.

The example below demonstrates segmentation evaluation by comparing the
masks generated by two DeepLabv3 models (with
:ref:`ResNet50 <model-zoo-deeplabv3-resnet50-coco-torch>` and
:ref:`ResNet101 <model-zoo-deeplabv3-resnet101-coco-torch>` backbones):

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

        dataset_name="segmentation-eval-demo",
        max_samples=10,

    )

    # The models are trained on the VOC classes
    CLASSES = (

        "diningtable,dog,horse,motorbike,person,pottedplant,sheep,sofa,train," +
        "tvmonitor"
    )
    dataset.default_mask_targets = {
        idx: label for idx, label in enumerate(CLASSES.split(","))
    }

    # Add DeepLabv3-ResNet101 predictions to dataset
    model = foz.load_zoo_model("deeplabv3-resnet101-coco-torch")
    dataset.apply_model(model, "resnet101")

    # Add DeepLabv3-ResNet50 predictions to dataset
    model = foz.load_zoo_model("deeplabv3-resnet50-coco-torch")
    dataset.apply_model(model, "resnet50")

    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the masks w/ ResNet50 backbone, treating the masks w/ ResNet101
    # backbone as "ground truth"

Advanced usage
______________

.. _evaluating-views:

Evaluating views into your dataset
----------------------------------

All evaluation methods are exposed on |DatasetView| objects, which means that
you can define arbitrarily complex views into your datasets and run evaluation
on those.

For example, the snippet below evaluates only the medium-sized objects in a
dataset:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart", dataset_name="eval-demo")
    dataset.compute_metadata()

    # Create an expression that will match objects whose bounding boxes have
    # areas between 32^2 and 96^2 pixels
    bbox_area = (
        F("$metadata.width") * F("bounding_box")[2] *
        F("$metadata.height") * F("bounding_box")[3]
    )
    medium_boxes = (32 ** 2 < bbox_area) & (bbox_area < 96 ** 2)

    # Create a view that contains only medium-sized objects
    medium_view = (
        dataset
        .filter_labels("ground_truth", medium_boxes)
        .filter_labels("predictions", medium_boxes)
    )

    print(medium_view)

    # Evaluate the medium-sized objects
    results = medium_view.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions",
        gt_field="ground_truth",
        eval_key="eval_medium",
    )

    # Print some aggregate metrics
    print(results.metrics())

    # View results in the App
    session = fo.launch_app(view=medium_view)

.. note::

    If you run evaluation on a complex view, don't worry, you can always
    :ref:`load the view later <load-evaluation-view>`!

.. _load-evaluation-view:

Loading a previous evaluation result
------------------------------------

You can view a list of evaluation keys for evaluations that you have previously
run on a dataset via
:meth:`list_evaluations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_evaluations>`.

Evaluation keys are stored at the dataset-level, but if a particular evaluation
was run on a view into your dataset, you can use
:meth:`load_evaluation_view() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_evaluation_view>`
to retrieve the exact view on which you evaluated:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    dataset = fo.load_dataset(...)

    # List available evaluations
    dataset.list_evaluations()
    # ["my_eval1", "my_eval2", ...]

    # Load the view into the dataset on which `my_eval1` was run
    eval1_view = dataset.load_evaluation_view("my_eval1")

.. note::

    If you have run multiple evaluations on a dataset, you can use the
    `select_fields` parameter of the
    :meth:`load_evaluation_view() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_evaluation_view>`
    method to hide any fields that were populated by other evaluation runs,
    allowing you to, for example, focus on a specific set of evaluation results
    in the App:

    .. code-block:: python

        import fiftyone as fo

        dataset = fo.load_dataset(...)

        # Load a view that contains the results of evaluation `my_eval1` and
        # hides all other evaluation data
        eval1_view = dataset.load_evaluation_view("my_eval1", select_fields=True)

        session = fo.launch_app(view=eval1_view)

.. _evaluating-videos:

Evaluating videos
-----------------

All evaluation methods can be applied to frame-level labels in addition to
sample-level labels.

You can evaluate frame-level labels of a video dataset by adding the ``frames``
prefix to the relevant prediction and ground truth frame fields.

.. note::

    When evaluating frame-level labels, helpful statistics are tabulated at
    both the sample- and frame-levels of your dataset. Refer to the
    documentation of the relevant evaluation method for more details.

The example below demonstrates evaluating (mocked) frame-level detections on
the :ref:`quickstart-video dataset <dataset-zoo-quickstart-video>` from the
Dataset Zoo:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import random

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "quickstart-video", dataset_name="video-eval-demo"
    )

    #
    # Create some test predictions by copying the ground truth objects into a
    # new `predictions` field of the frames with 10% of the labels perturbed at
    # random
    #

    classes = dataset.distinct("frames.detections.detections.label")

    def jitter(val):
        if random.random() < 0.10:
            return random.choice(classes)

        return val

    predictions = []
    for sample_gts in dataset.values("frames.detections"):
        sample_predictions = []
        for frame_gts in sample_gts:
            sample_predictions.append(
                fo.Detections(
                    detections=[
                        fo.Detection(
                            label=jitter(gt.label),
                            bounding_box=gt.bounding_box,
                            confidence=random.random(),
                        )
                        for gt in frame_gts.detections
                    ]
                )
            )

        predictions.append(sample_predictions)

    dataset.set_values("frames.predictions", predictions)

    print(dataset)

    # Evaluate the frame-level `predictions` against the frame-level
    # `detections` objects

You can also view frame-level evaluation results as
:ref:`evaluation patches <evaluation-patches>` by first converting
:ref:`to frames <frame-views>` and then :ref:`to patches <eval-patches-views>`!

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Convert to frame evaluation patches
    frames = dataset.to_frames(sample_frames=True)
    frame_eval_patches = frames.to_evaluation_patches("eval")
    print(frame_eval_patches)

    print(frame_eval_patches.count_values("type"))
    # {'tp': 10578, 'fn': 767, 'fp': 767}
