Creating a Dataset
==================

.. include:: ../../substitutions.rst
.. default-role:: code

FiftyOne supports automatic creation of datasets stored in various common
formats. If your dataset is stored in a custom format, don't worry, FiftyOne
also provides support for easily create custom data formats as well.

.. note::


    When you create a FiftyOne |Dataset3|_, its samples and all of their fields
    (metadata, labels, custom fields, etc.) are written to FiftyOne's backing
    database.

    Note, however, that samples only store the `filepath` to the media, not the
    raw media itself. FiftyOne does not create duplicate copies of your data!

**Dataset formats**

There are three basic ways to get data into FiftyOne:

- :doc:`Common format datasets<common_datasets>`

FiftyOne natively supports creating datasets in a variety of common formats,
including
`COCO <https://cocodataset.org/#home>`_,
`VOC <http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC>`_,
`CVAT <https://github.com/opencv/cvat>`_,
`BDD <https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu>`_,
`TFRecords <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>`_,
and more.

- :doc:`Zoo datasets<zoo_datasets>`

FiftyOne provides a Dataset Zoo that contains a variety of popular open source
datasets like
`CIFAR-10 <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>`_,
`COCO <https://cocodataset.org/#home>`_, and
`ImageNet <http://www.image-net.org>`_
that can be downloaded and loaded into FiftyOne with a single line of code.

- :doc:`Custom format datasets<custom_datasets>`

If your data is stored in a custom format, you can easily get it into FiftyOne
by directly adding the samples and their fields to a FiftyOne Dataset in a
variety of formats. You can even provide your own sample parser to automate
this process.

**Quickstart**

Ingest a directory of images into FiftyOne and explore them in the FiftyOne
App:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Python

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        import fiftyone as fo

        dataset_dir = "/path/to/images-dir"

        # Visualize a directory of images in the FiftyOne App
        dataset = fo.Dataset.from_dir(dataset_dir, fo.types.ImageDirectory)
        session = fo.launch_app(dataset=dataset)

  .. group-tab:: CLI

    .. code:: shell

        # Visualize a directory of images in the FiftyOne App
        fiftyone app view \
            --dataset-dir /path/to/images-dir --type fiftyone.types.ImageDirectory
