Summary: What You've Learned
============================

.. default-role:: code

Congratulations! You've completed the Model Dataset Zoo Guide. Let's recap what you've accomplished and explore where you can go next.

Step-by-Step Recap
------------------

**Step 1: Exploring the FiftyOne Dataset Zoo**

You discovered how to access and visualize public datasets directly from the FiftyOne Dataset Zoo, including support for remotely-sourced datasets defined in GitHub repositories or cloud URLs. You learned how to list available datasets, understand their structure, and load them for immediate use in your workflows.

**Step 2: Using the FiftyOne Model Zoo**

You explored how to apply pre-trained models like classifiers and object detectors to your datasets. You learned to quickly generate predictions, inspect results within the FiftyOne App, and iterate faster on your computer vision tasks using the built-in zoo infrastructure.

**Step 3: Using Remotely-Sourced Zoo Models**

You mastered how to load and use external models hosted in public repositories or shared via URL-based archives. You learned to wrap and integrate them seamlessly into the FiftyOne Model Zoo interface, extending the zoo's capabilities with custom or community models.

Suggested Exercises
------------------

1. **Custom Dataset Creation**: Create your own dataset definition and host it on GitHub, then load it through the zoo interface.

2. **Model Performance Comparison**: Load multiple models for the same task and compare their performance on your datasets.

3. **Zoo Extension**: Wrap your own custom model and integrate it with the zoo for team collaboration.

4. **Dataset Curation**: Use the zoo to explore multiple datasets and curate a combined dataset for your specific use case.

5. **Workflow Automation**: Build automated pipelines that leverage zoo datasets and models for production workflows.
