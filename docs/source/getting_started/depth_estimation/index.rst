Depth Estimation Datasets
-------------------------

**DIODE (Dense Indoor and Outdoor DEpth) Dataset**

The DIODE dataset is the first public dataset to include RGBD images of both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a single sensor suite. Key features include:

- High-resolution color images (1024 Ã— 768) with accurate depth measurements
- Both indoor and outdoor scenes for diverse training scenarios
- Depth validity masks indicating reliable sensor measurements
- NumPy-based storage format for precise depth values
- Far-range depth measurements up to 300 meters

Created by researchers from TTI-Chicago, University of Chicago, and Beihang University, DIODE provides ground truth depth data suitable for training and evaluating monocular depth estimation models.

**NYU Depth Dataset V2**

A benchmark dataset for indoor depth estimation containing RGB-D images captured in various indoor environments. Features include:

- 1449 densely labeled RGB-D images
- Diverse indoor scenes (bedrooms, living rooms, offices, bathrooms, etc.)
- Image-based depth map storage (PNG format)
- Sequential frame data for temporal analysis
- Rich metadata for scene organization

**CLEVR with Depth Dataset**

A synthetic dataset from Hugging Face Hub containing:

- Rendered 3D scenes with precise depth information
- Clean depth maps without sensor noise
- Text prompts describing each scene
- Ideal for testing depth estimation algorithms in controlled settings

.. _depth_estimation-formats:

Depth Map Formats
-----------------

Different datasets store depth information in various formats:

- **NumPy arrays**: Direct numerical storage (`.npy` files) with metric depth values
- **16-bit PNG**: High-precision image-based storage for depth maps
- **8-bit normalized**: Scaled depth for visualization purposes
- **Metric vs. Inverse**: Absolute distance or inverse depth encoding

FiftyOne uses the `Heatmap <https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/using_datasets.html#heatmaps>`_ class to represent depth data, supporting both array-based and file-based storage with flexible visualization options.

.. _depth_estimation-models:

Depth Estimation Models
-----------------------

This guide covers multiple approaches to running depth estimation models:

**FiftyOne Model Zoo**

Pre-integrated Hugging Face transformers models accessible via FiftyOne's Model Zoo:

- Depth-Anything V2 (small, base, large variants)
- Intel DPT (Dense Prediction Transformer) models
- ZoeDepth for metric depth estimation
- GLPN (Global-Local Path Networks)

**Hugging Face Transformers**

Manual integration for models not in the Model Zoo, including:

- DPT-BEiT models for high-quality depth
- MiDaS variants for general-purpose depth
- Custom fine-tuned models

**Community Plugins**

FiftyOne plugins extending depth estimation capabilities:

- `DepthPro plugin <https://docs.voxel51.com/plugins/plugins_ecosystem/depth_pro_plugin.html>`_ for state-of-the-art depth estimation
- Delegated execution for processing large datasets

**Diffusers Library**

Zero-shot depth prediction using:

- Marigold Depth models
- Stable Diffusion-based depth estimation
- 16-bit precision depth map export

Depth Estimation Workflow
-------------------------

This tutorial demonstrates a complete depth estimation workflow that combines:

1. **Data Loading** - Loading different depth map formats (NumPy arrays, PNG images) with proper metadata handling

2. **Depth Visualization** - Creating color-coded visualizations with appropriate range scaling

3. **Model Integration** - Running multiple depth estimation models from FiftyOne Model Zoo, Hugging Face, plugins, and Diffusers

4. **Dataset Organization** - Structuring depth datasets with metadata and preparing data for analysis

This integrated approach gives you the tools to not just load depth data, but to run state-of-the-art models, compare predictions, and build production-ready depth estimation pipelines.
