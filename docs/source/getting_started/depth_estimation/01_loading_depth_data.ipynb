    "## DIODE Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "DIODE (Dense Indoor and Outdoor DEpth) is a dataset of high-resolution color images with accurate, dense, far-range depth measurements. The DIODE dataset was created by researchers from TTI-Chicago, University of Chicago, and Beihang University, and is released under the MIT license. It was last updated on March 31, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the first public dataset to include RGBD images of both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a single sensor suite.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Naming Conventions and Formats  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of RGB images, depth maps, and depth validity masks. Their formats are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RGB images (`*.png`): RGB images with a resolution of 1024 Ã— 768.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Depth maps (`*_depth.npy`): Depth ground truth with the same resolution as the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Depth masks (`*_depth_mask.npy`): Binary depth validity masks where 1 indicates valid sensor returns and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between depth maps and depth validity masks is quite important for working with depth data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth Maps** contain the actual distance measurements from the camera to surfaces in the scene. Each pixel value represents how far away that point is (usually in meters). However, depth sensors often have limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth Validity Masks** indicate which pixels in the depth map have reliable measurements:\n",
    "  - A value of 1 means the depth value is valid and can be trusted\n",
    "  - A value of 0 means the depth sensor couldn't get a reliable reading at that pixel\n",
    "\n",
    "These invalid readings typically occur because:\n",
    "1. Some surfaces are too reflective, transparent, or absorptive\n",
    "2. Areas may be too far away or outside the sensor's range\n",
    "3. Occlusions where one object blocks the sensor's view of another\n",
    "4. Motion blur during capture\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the validity mask, you'd be treating unreliable depth values as real measurements, which would introduce significant errors in any algorithms or visualizations using the depth data.\n",

    "### Loading DIODE Depth Data into FiftyOne\n",
    "\n",
    "This code converts the DIODE depth dataset into a FiftyOne dataset for visualization and exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth Maps as Heatmaps\n",
    "\n",
    "The function processes depth data in several important steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the raw depth**: The depth maps are loaded from NumPy files, containing metric distance values in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying the mask**: Not all pixels have valid depth measurements. The function applies the depth mask to zero out invalid measurements, ensuring we only visualize reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computing visualization range**: To create meaningful visualizations, the function calculates an appropriate min/max range based on the actual depth values present in each image. It uses the minimum value and the 99th percentile (capped at 300 meters) to avoid outliers skewing the visualization. This is informed by the [source code](https://github.com/diode-dataset/diode-devkit/blob/8b1765b7d801a5f5e2877c434ffe164e62ce8c90/diode.py#L60) for the DIODE Dev Kit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating the Heatmap**: The masked depth map is stored as a FiftyOne Heatmap with the calculated range, allowing for intuitive color-coded visualization when viewing the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth Masks\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth mask indicates which depth measurements are valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mask value of 1 means the depth measurement is valid and trustworthy\n",
    "- A mask value of 0 indicates an invalid measurement (typically due to reflective surfaces, sensor limitations, or occlusions)\n",
    "\n",
    "By storing both the masked depth map and the mask itself as separate fields, you can easily visualize which areas have valid depth readings and which don't. This is particularly important for depth estimation tasks where you need to know which ground truth values you can rely on for training or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting FiftyOne dataset contains:\n",
    "- RGB images as the primary media\n",
    "- Depth maps as heatmaps with appropriate visualization ranges\n",
    "- Binary depth masks indicating valid measurements\n",
    "- Metadata fields including scene type, split, scene ID, and scan ID\n",

    "When working with the NYU dataset, the main difference is how we access and load the depth information:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth Maps as Image Files\n",

    "\n",
    "The depth maps are integrated as FiftyOne Heatmap objects, which enables specialized visualization. The code uses the [map_path](https://docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Heatmap) parameter to reference the depth files directly.\n",

    "- Verifying required columns in the input DataFrame\n",
    "- Converting relative paths to absolute paths\n",
    "- Checking that files exist before processing\n",
    "- Extracting structured metadata from filenames and paths\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interactive Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created, this dataset can be explored in the FiftyOne App, where you can:\n",
    "- Browse through RGB-depth pairs\n",
    "- Filter by room type, scene, or frame number\n",
    "- Visualize depth maps with different colormaps\n",
