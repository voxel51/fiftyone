Summary: What You've Learned
============================

.. default-role:: code

Congratulations! You've completed the Segmentation Guide. Let's recap what you've accomplished and explore where you can go next.

.. _summary-step-recap:

Step-by-Step Recap
------------------

**Step 1: Loading Segmentation Datasets**

You learned how to load segmentation datasets into FiftyOne using both built-in datasets from the zoo and custom datasets in COCO or mask folder format. You mastered the concept of dataset ingestion and how to properly configure different segmentation formats for optimal visualization and analysis.

**Step 2: Adding Instance Segmentations**

You explored how to add instance segmentation predictions to your datasets using both pre-trained models like SAM2 and your own models, including how to convert polygons and bounding boxes into masks. You learned the fundamentals of model integration and prediction management in FiftyOne.

**Step 3: Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) in FiftyOne**

You dove into the advanced image and video segmentation capabilities of SAM 2, including prompting via bounding boxes or keypoints, and automatic segmentation for visual AI workflows. You discovered how to leverage cutting-edge segmentation models for zero-shot and prompted segmentation tasks.

Suggested Exercises
------------------

1. **Multi-Format Dataset Loading**: Try loading different segmentation dataset formats (VOC, YOLO, custom) and compare how FiftyOne handles each format.

2. **Custom Model Integration**: Implement your own segmentation model and integrate it with FiftyOne's prediction pipeline.

3. **Advanced SAM2 Prompting**: Experiment with different prompt types (text, keypoints, multiple bounding boxes) to see how SAM2 responds.

4. **Video Segmentation**: Work with video datasets and explore SAM2's video mask propagation capabilities.

5. **Dataset Curation**: Use FiftyOne's filtering and search capabilities to identify specific segmentation patterns or failure cases in your dataset.
