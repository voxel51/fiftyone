============================

.. default-role:: code

Congratulations! You've completed the Model Evaluation Guide. Let's recap what you've accomplished and explore where you can go next.

Step-by-Step Recap
------------------

**Step 1: Basic Model Evaluation**

You learned how to evaluate model predictions against ground truth using FiftyOne's powerful evaluation API. This included computing precision, recall, mAP, and other essential metrics for both detection and classification tasks. You discovered how FiftyOne handles format conversions automatically, making evaluation seamless regardless of your data format.

**Step 2: Advanced Evaluation Analysis**

You mastered FiftyOne's Model Evaluation Panel, learning how to visualize model confidence distributions, sort samples by false positives and false negatives, and filter datasets based on performance metrics. This interactive analysis helped you identify model weaknesses and understand where your models need improvement.

Suggested Exercises
------------------

1. **Multi-Model Comparison**: Load predictions from multiple models (e.g., different YOLO versions, Faster R-CNN, SSD) and compare their performance side-by-side. Which model performs best on different object categories?

2. **Custom Dataset Integration**: Apply these evaluation techniques to your own datasets. How do the evaluation workflows help improve your specific use case?

3. **Confidence Threshold Optimization**: Experiment with different confidence thresholds and analyze how they affect precision-recall trade-offs. Find the optimal threshold for your application.

4. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Use the evaluation results to identify patterns in model mistakes. Are there specific object categories, sizes, or scenarios where your model consistently fails?

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up regular evaluation workflows to monitor model performance over time and detect performance drift.
