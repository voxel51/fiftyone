Step-by-Step Recap
------------------

**Step 1: Getting Started with Manufacturing Datasets**

You learned how to load and explore manufacturing datasets in FiftyOne, specifically working with MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset. This included understanding defect patterns, preparing data for analysis, and exploring different object categories in manufacturing environments.

**Step 2: Understanding and Using Embeddings**

You mastered generating embeddings for anomaly detection tasks, understanding their importance in Visual AI, and using them for similarity search and visualization in manufacturing contexts.

**Step 3: Clustering and Labeling with Embeddings**

You learned how to perform clustering analysis to group anomalies and normal samples, use embeddings for automatic dataset labeling and cleanup, and leverage FiftyOne's clustering plugins.

**Step 4: Custom Embeddings for Industrial Data**

You gained experience using custom feature extractors to compute embeddings tailored for industrial data and manufacturing scenarios, improving model performance for specific use cases.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation and Integration**

You explored FiftyOne's integration capabilities, plugin system, and model evaluation tools, learning how to assess model performance and integrate with external frameworks.

**Step 6: Data Augmentation for Manufacturing**

You applied Albumentations for data augmentation, learning how to improve model robustness for manufacturing scenarios with industrial-specific augmentations.

**Step 7: 3D Visualization for Defect Inspection**

You explored advanced visualization techniques with 3D sensor data and meshes for defect inspection, working with MVTec 3D dataset and point cloud data.

**Step 8: Extended Dataset Exploration**

You dove deeper into dataset splits, statistics, and visual inspection workflows, gaining comprehensive understanding of manufacturing dataset structure.

**Step 9: Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD)**

You worked with large-scale datasets collected from actual automotive production lines, understanding real-world manufacturing scenarios and complex defect patterns.

**Step 10: PPE Detection and Safety Monitoring**

You implemented safety monitoring workflows with Personal Protective Equipment compliance detection, learning how to monitor worker safety in manufacturing environments.

**Step 11: Video Analytics for Safety**

You explored video analytics for behavior monitoring and safety compliance, using TwelveLabs integration for video embeddings and advanced video analysis.
