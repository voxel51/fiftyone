This page lists all of the natively available datasets in the FiftyOne Dataset
Zoo.

Check out the :ref:`API reference <dataset-zoo-api>` for complete instructions
for using the Dataset Zoo.

.. note::

    Some datasets are loaded via the
    `TorchVision Datasets <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html>`_
    or `TensorFlow Datasets <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets>`_ packages
    under the hood.

    If you do not have a :ref:`suitable package <dataset-zoo-ml-backend>`
    installed when attempting to download a zoo dataset, you'll see an error
    message that will help you install one.

.. _dataset-zoo-activitynet-100:

ActivityNet 100
---------------

ActivityNet is a large-scale video dataset for human activity understanding
supporting the tasks of global video classification, trimmed activity
classification, and temporal activity detection.

This version contains videos and temporal activity detections for the 100 class
version of the dataset.

.. note::

    Check out :ref:`this guide <activitynet>` for more details on using
    FiftyOne to work with ActivityNet.

**Notes**

-   ActivityNet 100 and 200 differ in the number of activity classes and
    videos per split
-   Partial downloads will download videos (if still available) from YouTube
-   Full splits can be loaded by first downloading the official source files
    from the
    `ActivityNet maintainers <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKaFq9ZfcmZ7W0B0PbEhfbTHY41GeEgwsa7WobJgGUhn4DTQ/viewform>`_
-   The test set does not have annotations

**Details**

-   Dataset name: ``activitynet-100``
-   Dataset source: http://activity-net.org/index.html
-   Dataset size: 223 GB
-   Tags: ``video, classification, action-recognition, temporal-detection``
-   Supported splits: ``train, validation, test``
-   ZooDataset class:
    :class:`ActivityNet100Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.ActivityNet100Dataset>`

**Full split stats**

-   Train split: 4,819 videos (7,151 instances)
-   Test split: 2,480 videos (labels withheld)
-   Validation split: 2,383 videos (3,582 instances)

**Partial downloads**

FiftyOne provides parameters that can be used to efficiently download specific
subsets of the ActivityNet dataset to suit your needs. When new subsets are
specified, FiftyOne will use existing downloaded data first if possible before
resorting to downloading additional data from YouTube.

The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of
ActivityNet 100 by passing them to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`:

-   **split** (*None*) and **splits** (*None*): a string or list of strings,
    respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are
    ``("train", "test", "validation")``. If none are provided, all available
    splits are loaded

-   **source_dir** (*None*): the directory containing the manually downloaded
    ActivityNet files used to avoid downloading videos from YouTube

-   **classes** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    classes to load. If provided, only samples containing at least one instance
    of a specified class will be loaded

-   **max_duration** (*None*): only videos with a duration in seconds that is
    less than or equal to the `max_duration` will be downloaded. By default,
    all videos are downloaded

-   **copy_files** (*True*): whether to move (False) or create copies (True) of
    the source files when populating ``dataset_dir``. This is only relevant
    when a ``source_dir`` is provided

-   **num_workers** (*None*): the number of processes to use when downloading
    individual videos. By default, ``multiprocessing.cpu_count()`` is used

-   **shuffle** (*False*): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which
    samples are chosen for partial downloads

-   **seed** (*None*): a random seed to use when shuffling

-   **max_samples** (*None*): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If
    ``classes`` are also specified, only up to the number of samples that
    contain at least one specified class will be loaded. By default, all
    matching samples are loaded

.. note::

    See
    :class:`ActivityNet100Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.ActivityNet100Dataset>` and
    :class:`ActivityNetDatasetImporter <fiftyone.utils.activitynet.ActivityNetDatasetImporter>`
    for complete descriptions of the optional keyword arguments that you can
    pass to :func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

**Full split downloads**

Many videos have been removed from YouTube since the creation of ActivityNet.
As a result, if you do not specify any partial download parameters defined in
the previous section, you must first download the official source files from
the ActivityNet maintainers in order to load a full split into FiftyOne.

To download the source files, you must fill out
`this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKaFq9ZfcmZ7W0B0PbEhfbTHY41GeEgwsa7WobJgGUhn4DTQ/viewform>`_.

Refer to :ref:`this page <activitynet-full-split-downloads>` to see how to load
full splits by passing the `source_dir` parameter to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

the previous section, you must first download the official source files from
the ActivityNet maintainers in order to load a full split into FiftyOne.

To download the source files, you must fill out
`this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKaFq9ZfcmZ7W0B0PbEhfbTHY41GeEgwsa7WobJgGUhn4DTQ/viewform>`_.

Refer to :ref:`this page <activitynet-full-split-downloads>` to see how to load
full splits by passing the `source_dir` parameter to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

BDD100K
-------

The Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) dataset is one of the largest and most diverse
video datasets for autonomous vehicles.

The BDD100K dataset contains 100,000 video clips collected from more than
50,000 rides covering New York, San Francisco Bay Area, and other regions.
The dataset contains diverse scene types such as city streets, residential
areas, and highways. Furthermore, the videos were recorded in diverse
weather conditions at different times of the day.

The videos are split into training (70K), validation (10K) and testing
(20K) sets. Each video is 40 seconds long with 720p resolution and a frame
rate of 30fps. The frame at the 10th second of each video is annotated for
image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

This version of the dataset contains only the 100K images extracted from
the videos as described above, together with the image classification,
detection, and segmentation labels.

.. note::

    In order to load the BDD100K dataset, you must download the source data
    manually. The directory should be organized in the following format:

version of the dataset.

.. note::

    With support from the `COCO team <https://cocodataset.org/#download>`_,
    FiftyOne is a recommended tool for downloading, visualizing, and evaluating
    on the COCO dataset!

    Check out :ref:`this guide <coco>` for more details on using FiftyOne to
    work with COCO.

**Notes**

-   COCO defines 91 classes but the data only uses 80 classes
-   Some images from the train and validation sets don't have annotations
-   The test set does not have annotations
-   COCO 2014 and 2017 use the same images, but the splits are different

**Details**

-   Dataset name: ``coco-2014``
-   Dataset source: http://cocodataset.org/#home
-   Dataset size: 37.57 GB
-   Tags: ``image, detection, segmentation``
-   Supported splits: ``train, validation, test``
-   ZooDataset class:
    :class:`COCO2014Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.COCO2014Dataset>`

**Full split stats**

-   Train split: 82,783 images
-   Test split: 40,775 images
-   Validation split: 40,504 images

**Partial downloads**

FiftyOne provides parameters that can be used to efficiently download specific
subsets of the COCO dataset to suit your needs. When new subsets are specified,
FiftyOne will use existing downloaded data first if possible before resorting
to downloading additional data from the web.

The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of
COCO-2014 by passing them to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`:

-   **split** (*None*) and **splits** (*None*): a string or list of strings,
    respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are
    ``("train", "test", "validation")``. If neither is provided, all available
    splits are loaded

-   **label_types** (*None*): a label type or list of label types to load.
    Supported values are ``("detections", "segmentations")``. By default, only
    detections are loaded

-   **classes** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    classes to load. If provided, only samples containing at least one instance
    of a specified class will be loaded

-   **image_ids** (*None*): a list of specific image IDs to load. The IDs can
    be specified either as ``<split>/<image-id>`` strings or ``<image-id>``
    ints of strings. Alternatively, you can provide the path to a TXT
    (newline-separated), JSON, or CSV file containing the list of image IDs to
    load in either of the first two formats

-   **include_id** (*False*): whether to include the COCO ID of each sample in
    the loaded labels

-   **include_license** (*False*): whether to include the COCO license of each
    sample in the loaded labels, if available. The supported values are:

    -   ``"False"`` (default): don't load the license
    -   ``True``/``"name"``: store the string license name
    -   ``"id"``: store the integer license ID
    -   ``"url"``: store the license URL

-   **only_matching** (*False*): whether to only load labels that match the
    ``classes`` or ``attrs`` requirements that you provide (True), or to load
    all labels for samples that match the requirements (False)

-   **num_workers** (*None*): the number of processes to use when downloading
    individual images. By default, `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` is used

-   **shuffle** (*False*): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which
    samples are chosen for partial downloads

-   **seed** (*None*): a random seed to use when shuffling

-   **max_samples** (*None*): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If
    ``label_types`` and/or ``classes`` are also specified, first priority will
    be given to samples that contain all of the specified label types and/or
    classes, followed by samples that contain at least one of the specified
    labels types or classes. The actual number of samples loaded may be less
    than this maximum value if the dataset does not contain sufficient samples
    matching your requirements

.. note::

    See
    :class:`COCO2014Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.COCO2014Dataset>` and
    :class:`COCODetectionDatasetImporter <fiftyone.utils.coco.COCODetectionDatasetImporter>`
    for complete descriptions of the optional keyword arguments that you can
    pass to :func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

COCO-2017
---------

COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning
dataset.

This version contains images, bounding boxes, and segmentations for the 2017
version of the dataset.

.. note::

    With support from the `COCO team <https://cocodataset.org/#download>`_,
    FiftyOne is a recommended tool for downloading, visualizing, and evaluating
    on the COCO dataset!

    Check out :ref:`this guide <coco>` for more details on using FiftyOne to
    work with COCO.

**Notes**

-   COCO defines 91 classes but the data only uses 80 classes
-   Some images from the train and validation sets don't have annotations
-   The test set does not have annotations
-   COCO 2014 and 2017 use the same images, but the splits are different

**Details**

-   Dataset name: ``coco-2017``
-   Dataset source: http://cocodataset.org/#home
-   Dataset size: 25.20 GB
-   Tags: ``image, detection, segmentation``
-   Supported splits: ``train, validation, test``
-   ZooDataset class:
    :class:`COCO2017Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.COCO2017Dataset>`

**Full split stats**

-   Train split: 118,287 images
-   Test split: 40,670 images
-   Validation split: 5,000 images

**Partial downloads**

FiftyOne provides parameters that can be used to efficiently download specific
subsets of the COCO dataset to suit your needs. When new subsets are specified,
FiftyOne will use existing downloaded data first if possible before resorting
to downloading additional data from the web.

The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of
COCO-2017 by passing them to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`:

-   **split** (*None*) and **splits** (*None*): a string or list of strings,
    respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are
    ``("train", "test", "validation")``. If neither is provided, all available
    splits are loaded

-   **label_types** (*None*): a label type or list of label types to load.
    Supported values are ``("detections", "segmentations")``. By default, only
    detections are loaded

-   **classes** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    classes to load. If provided, only samples containing at least one instance
    of a specified class will be loaded

-   **image_ids** (*None*): a list of specific image IDs to load. The IDs can
    be specified either as ``<split>/<image-id>`` strings or ``<image-id>``
    ints of strings. Alternatively, you can provide the path to a TXT
    (newline-separated), JSON, or CSV file containing the list of image IDs to
    load in either of the first two formats

-   **include_id** (*False*): whether to include the COCO ID of each sample in
    the loaded labels

-   **include_license** (*False*): whether to include the COCO license of each
    sample in the loaded labels, if available. The supported values are:

    -   ``"False"`` (default): don't load the license
    -   ``True``/``"name"``: store the string license name
    -   ``"id"``: store the integer license ID
    -   ``"url"``: store the license URL

-   **only_matching** (*False*): whether to only load labels that match the
    ``classes`` or ``attrs`` requirements that you provide (True), or to load
    all labels for samples that match the requirements (False)

-   **num_workers** (*None*): the number of processes to use when downloading
    individual images. By default, `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` is used

-   **shuffle** (*False*): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which
    samples are chosen for partial downloads

-   **seed** (*None*): a random seed to use when shuffling

-   **max_samples** (*None*): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If
    ``label_types`` and/or ``classes`` are also specified, first priority will
    be given to samples that contain all of the specified label types and/or
    classes, followed by samples that contain at least one of the specified
    labels types or classes. The actual number of samples loaded may be less
    than this maximum value if the dataset does not contain sufficient samples
    matching your requirements

.. note::

    See
    :class:`COCO2017Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.COCO2017Dataset>` and
    :class:`COCODetectionDatasetImporter <fiftyone.utils.coco.COCODetectionDatasetImporter>`
    for complete descriptions of the optional keyword arguments that you can
    pass to :func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

Families in the Wild
--------------------

Families in the Wild is a public benchmark for recognizing families via facial
images. The dataset contains over 26,642 images of 5,037 faces collected from
978 families. A unique Family ID (FID) is assigned per family, ranging from
F0001-F1018 (i.e., some families were merged or removed since its first release
in 2016). The dataset is a continued work in progress. Any contributions are
both welcome and appreciated!

Faces were cropped from imagery using the five-point face detector MTCNN from
various phototypes (i.e., mostly family photos, along with several profile pics
of individuals (facial shots). The number of members per family varies from
3-to-26, with the number of faces per subject ranging from 1 to >10.

Various levels and types of labels are associated with samples in this dataset.
Family-level labels contain a list of members, each assigned a member ID (MID)
unique to that respective family (e.g., F0011.MID2 refers to member 2 of family
11). Each member has annotations specifying gender and relationship to all
other members in that respective family.

The relationships in FIW are:

.. code-block:: text

    =====  =====
      ID    Type
    =====  =====
        0  not related or self
        1  child
        2  sibling
        3  grandchild
        4  parent
        5  spouse
        6  grandparent
        7  great grandchild
        8  great grandparent
        9  TBD
    =====  =====

Within FiftyOne, each sample corresponds to a single face image and contains
primitive labels of the Family ID, Member ID, etc. The relationship labels are
stored as :ref:`multi-label classifications <multilabel-classification>`,
where each classification represents one relationship that the member has with
another member in the family. The number of relationships will differ from one
person to the next, but all faces of one person will have the same relationship
labels.

Additionally, the labels for the
`Kinship Verification task <https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21843>`_
are also loaded into this dataset through FiftyOne. These labels are stored
as classifications just like relationships, but the labels of kinship differ
from those defined above. For example, rather than Parent, the label might be
`fd` representing a Father-Daughter kinship or `md` for Mother-Daughter.

In order to make it easier to browse the dataset in the FiftyOne App, each
sample also contains a `face_id` field containing a unique integer for each
face of a member, always starting at 0. This allows you to filter the `face_id`
field to 0 in the App to show only a single image of each person.

For your reference, the relationship labels are stored in disk in a matrix that
provides the relationship of each member with other members of the family as
well as names and genders. The i-th rows represent the i-th family member's
relationship to the j-th other members.

For example, `FID0001.csv` contains:

.. code-block:: text

    MID     1     2     3     Name    Gender
     1      0     4     5     name1     f
     2      1     0     1     name2     f
     3      5     4     0     name3     m

Here we have three family members, as listed under the MID column (far-left).
Each MID reads across its row. We can see that MID1 is related to MID2 by
4 -> 1 (Parent -> Child), which of course can be viewed as the inverse, i.e.,
MID2 -> MID1 is 1 -> 4. It can also be seen that MID1 and MID3 are spouses of
one another, i.e., 5 -> 5.

.. note::

    The spouse label will likely be removed in future version of this
    dataset. It serves no value to the problem of kinship.

benchmarks, and more), see the recent journal:

.. _dataset-zoo-imagenet-2012:

ImageNet 2012
-------------

The ImageNet 2012 dataset.

ImageNet, as known as ILSVRC 2012, is an image dataset organized according
to the WordNet hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly
described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a "synonym set" or
"synset". There are more than 100,000 synsets in WordNet, majority of them
are nouns (80,000+). ImageNet provides on average 1,000 images to
illustrate each synset. Images of each concept are quality-controlled and
human-annotated. In its completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of
millions of cleanly sorted images for most of the concepts in the WordNet
hierarchy.

Note that labels were never publicly released for the test set, so only the
training and validation sets are provided.

.. note::

    In order to load the ImageNet dataset, you must download the source data
    manually. The directory should be organized in the following format:

    .. code-block:: text

        source_dir/
            ILSVRC2012_devkit_t12.tar.gz    # both splits

Kinetics 400
------------

Kinetics is a collection of large-scale, high-quality datasets of URL links of
up to 650,000 video clips that cover 400/600/700 human action classes,
depending on the dataset version. The videos include human-object interactions
such as playing instruments, as well as human-human interactions such as
shaking hands and hugging. Each action class has at least 400/600/700 video
clips. Each clip is human annotated with a single action class and lasts around
10 seconds.

This dataset contains videos and action classifications for the 400 class
version of the dataset.

**Details**

-   Dataset name: ``kinetics-400``
-   Dataset source: https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics
-   Dataset size: 456 GB
-   Tags: ``video, classification, action-recognition``
-   Supported splits: ``train, test, validation``
-   ZooDataset class:
    :class:`Kinetics400Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.Kinetics400Dataset>`

Original split stats:

-   Train split: 219,782 videos
-   Test split: 35,357 videos
-   Validation split: 18,035 videos

CVDF split stats:

-   Train split: 246,534 videos
-   Test split: 39,805 videos

-   Validation split: 30 GB

**Partial downloads**

Kinetics is a massive dataset, so FiftyOne provides parameters that can be used
to efficiently download specific subsets of the dataset to suit your needs.
When new subsets are specified, FiftyOne will use existing downloaded data
first if possible before resorting to downloading additional data from the web.

Kinetics videos were originally only accessible from YouTube. Over time, some
videos have become unavailable so the
`CVDF <https://github.com/cvdfoundation>`_ have hosted the Kinetics dataset on
AWS.

If you are partially downloading the dataset through FiftyOne, the specific
videos of interest will be downloaded from YouTube, if necessary. However,
when you load an entire split, the CVDF-provided files will be downloaded from
AWS.

The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of
Kinetics by passing them to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`:

-   **split** (*None*) and **splits** (*None*): a string or list of strings,
    respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are
    ``("train", "test", "validation")``. If neither is provided, all available
    splits are loaded

-   **classes** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    classes to load. If provided, only samples containing at least one instance
    of a specified class will be loaded

-   **num_workers** (*None*): the number of processes to use when downloading
    individual videos. By default, `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` is used

-   **shuffle** (*False*): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which
    samples are chosen for partial downloads

-   **seed** (*None*): a random seed to use when shuffling

-   **max_samples** (*None*): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If
    ``classes`` are also specified, only up to the number of samples that
    contain at least one specified class will be loaded. By default, all
    matching samples are loaded

.. note::

    Unlike other versions, Kinteics 400 does not have zips available by class
    so whenever either `classes` or `max_samples` is provided, videos will be
    downloaded from YouTube.

-   Validation split: 41,620 images (12 GB)

**Partial downloads**

Open Images is a massive dataset, so FiftyOne provides parameters that can be
used to efficiently download specific subsets of the dataset to suit your
needs. When new subsets are specified, FiftyOne will use existing downloaded
data first if possible before resorting to downloading additional data from the
web.

The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of Open
Images V6 by passing them to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`:

-   **split** (*None*) and **splits** (*None*): a string or list of strings,
    respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are
    ``("train", "test", "validation")``. If neither is provided, all available
    splits are loaded

-   **label_types** (*None*): a label type or list of label types to load.
    Supported values are
    ``("detections", "classifications", "relationships", "segmentations")``.
    By default, all labels types are loaded

-   **classes** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    classes to load. If provided, only samples containing at least one instance
    of a specified class will be loaded. You can use
    :func:`get_classes() <fiftyone.utils.openimages.get_classes>` and
    :func:`get_segmentation_classes() <fiftyone.utils.openimages.get_segmentation_classes>`
    to see the available classes and segmentation classes, respectively

-   **attrs** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    relationship attributes to load. This parameter is only applicable if
    ``label_types`` contains ``"relationships"``. If provided, only samples
    containing at least one instance of a specified attribute will be loaded.
    You can use
    :func:`get_attributes() <fiftyone.utils.openimages.get_attributes>`
    to see the available attributes

-   **image_ids** (*None*): a list of specific image IDs to load. The IDs can
    be specified either as ``<split>/<image-id>`` or ``<image-id>`` strings.
    Alternatively, you can provide the path to a TXT (newline-separated), JSON,
    or CSV file containing the list of image IDs to load in either of the first
    two formats

-   **include_id** (*True*): whether to include the Open Images ID of each
    sample in the loaded labels

-   **only_matching** (*False*): whether to only load labels that match the
    ``classes`` or ``attrs`` requirements that you provide (True), or to load
    all labels for samples that match the requirements (False)

-   **num_workers** (*None*): the number of processes to use when downloading
    individual images. By default, `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` is used

-   **shuffle** (*False*): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which
    samples are chosen for partial downloads

-   **seed** (*None*): a random seed to use when shuffling

-   **max_samples** (*None*): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If
    ``label_types``, ``classes``, and/or ``attrs`` are also specified, first
    priority will be given to samples that contain all of the specified label
    types, classes, and/or attributes, followed by samples that contain at
    least one of the specified labels types or classes. The actual number of
    samples loaded may be less than this maximum value if the dataset does not
    contain sufficient samples matching your requirements

.. note::

    See
    :class:`OpenImagesV6Dataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.OpenImagesV6Dataset>`
    and :class:`OpenImagesV6DatasetImporter <fiftyone.utils.openimages.OpenImagesV6DatasetImporter>`
    for complete descriptions of the optional keyword arguments that you can
    pass to :func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

-   Validation split: 5,000 images

**Partial downloads**

FiftyOne provides parameters that can be used to efficiently download specific
subsets of the Sama-COCO dataset to suit your needs. When new subsets are
specified, FiftyOne will use existing downloaded data first if possible before
resorting to downloading additional data from the web.

The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of
Sama-COCO by passing them to
:func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`:

-   **split** (*None*) and **splits** (*None*): a string or list of strings,
    respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are
    ``("train", "test", "validation")``. If neither is provided, all available
    splits are loaded

-   **label_types** (*None*): a label type or list of label types to load.
    Supported values are ``("detections", "segmentations")``. By default, only
    detections are loaded

-   **classes** (*None*): a string or list of strings specifying required
    classes to load. If provided, only samples containing at least one instance
    of a specified class will be loaded

-   **image_ids** (*None*): a list of specific image IDs to load. The IDs can
    be specified either as ``<split>/<image-id>`` strings or ``<image-id>``
    ints of strings. Alternatively, you can provide the path to a TXT
    (newline-separated), JSON, or CSV file containing the list of image IDs to
    load in either of the first two formats

-   **include_id** (*False*): whether to include the COCO ID of each sample in
    the loaded labels

-   **include_license** (*False*): whether to include the COCO license of each
    sample in the loaded labels, if available. The supported values are:

    -   ``"False"`` (default): don't load the license
    -   ``True``/``"name"``: store the string license name
    -   ``"id"``: store the integer license ID
    -   ``"url"``: store the license URL

-   **only_matching** (*False*): whether to only load labels that match the
    ``classes`` or ``attrs`` requirements that you provide (True), or to load
    all labels for samples that match the requirements (False)

-   **num_workers** (*None*): the number of processes to use when downloading
    individual images. By default, `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` is used

-   **shuffle** (*False*): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which
    samples are chosen for partial downloads

-   **seed** (*None*): a random seed to use when shuffling

-   **max_samples** (*None*): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If
    ``label_types`` and/or ``classes`` are also specified, first priority will
    be given to samples that contain all of the specified label types and/or
    classes, followed by samples that contain at least one of the specified
    labels types or classes. The actual number of samples loaded may be less
    than this maximum value if the dataset does not contain sufficient samples
    matching your requirements

.. note::

    See
    :class:`SamaCOCODataset <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.base.SamaCOCODataset>` and
    :class:`COCODetectionDatasetImporter <fiftyone.utils.coco.COCODetectionDatasetImporter>`
    for complete descriptions of the optional keyword arguments that you can
    pass to :func:`load_zoo_dataset() <fiftyone.zoo.datasets.load_zoo_dataset>`.

.. _dataset-zoo-ucf101:

UCF101
------

UCF101 is an action recognition data set of realistic action videos,
collected from YouTube, having 101 action categories. This data set is an
extension of UCF50 data set which has 50 action categories.

With 13,320 videos from 101 action categories, UCF101 gives the largest
diversity in terms of actions and with the presence of large variations in
camera motion, object appearance and pose, object scale, viewpoint,
cluttered background, illumination conditions, etc, it is the most
challenging data set to date. As most of the available action recognition
data sets are not realistic and are staged by actors, UCF101 aims to
encourage further research into action recognition by learning and
exploring new realistic action categories.

The videos in 101 action categories are grouped into 25 groups, where each
group can consist of 4-7 videos of an action. The videos from the same
group may share some common features, such as similar background, similar
viewpoint, etc.
