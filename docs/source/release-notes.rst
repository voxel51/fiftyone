  the sample grid (macro) and expanded sample view (micro) with respect to and
  filters or currently selected samples/labels
- Added a `LABEL TAGS` section to the Filters Sidebar to coincide with the
  introduction of label tags
- Added label tooltips that display on hover in the expanded sample view
- Expanded actions to list of button groups in the sample grid and expanded
  sample view

Brain

- Added a :meth:`compute_visualization() <fiftyone.brain.compute_visualization>` method that uses embeddings and dimensionality reduction methods to generate interactive visualizations of the samples and/or labels in a dataset. Check out :ref:`this page <brain-embeddings-visualization>` for details. Features include:
    - Provide your own embeddings, or choose a model from the
      :ref:`Model Zoo <model-zoo>`, or use the provided default model
