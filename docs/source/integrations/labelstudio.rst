Label Studio Integration
========================

.. default-role:: code

`Label Studio <https://labelstud.io/>`_ is a popular open-source data labeling
tool with a friendly UI. The integration between FiftyOne and Label Studio
allows you to easily upload your data directly from FiftyOne to Label Studio
for labeling.

You can get started with Label Studio through a simple pip install to get a
local server up and running. FiftyOne provides
:ref:`simple setup instructions <label-studio-setup>` that you can use to
specify the necessary account credentials and server endpoint to use.

FiftyOne provides an API to create projects, upload data, define label schemas,
and download annotations using Label Studio, all programmatically in Python.
All of the following label types are supported for image datasets:

- :ref:`Classification <classification>`
- :ref:`Detections <object-detection>`
- :ref:`Instance segmentations <instance-segmentation>`
- :ref:`Polygons and polylines <polylines>`
- :ref:`Keypoints <keypoints>`
- :ref:`Scalar fields <adding-sample-fields>`
- :ref:`Semantic segmentation <semantic-segmentation>`

.. _label-studio-basic-recipe:

Basic recipe
____________

The basic workflow to use Label Studio to add or edit labels on your FiftyOne
datasets is as follows:

1) Load a :ref:`labeled or unlabeled dataset <loading-datasets>` into FiftyOne

2) Explore the dataset using the :ref:`App <fiftyone-app>` or
   :ref:`dataset views <using-views>` to locate either unlabeled samples that
   you wish to annotate or labeled samples whose annotations you want to edit

3) Use the
   :meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>`
   method on your dataset or view to upload the samples and optionally their
   existing labels to Label Studio by setting the parameter
   `backend="labelstudio"`

4) In Label Studio, perform the necessary annotation work

5) Back in FiftyOne, load your dataset and use the
   :meth:`load_annotations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`
   method to merge the annotations back into your FiftyOne dataset

6) If desired, delete the Label Studio tasks and the record of the annotation
   run from your FiftyOne dataset

|br|
The example below demonstrates this workflow.

.. note::

    You must start by installing and setting up Label Studio as described in
    :ref:`this section <label-studio-setup>`.

    Note that you can also store your credentials to avoid entering them
    manually each time you interact with Label Studio.

First, we create the annotation tasks in Label Studio:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone import ViewField as F

    # Step 1: Load your data into FiftyOne

    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "quickstart", dataset_name="ls-annotation-example"
    )
    dataset.persistent = True

    dataset.evaluate_detections(
        "predictions", gt_field="ground_truth", eval_key="eval"
    )

    # Step 2: Locate a subset of your data requiring annotation

    # Create a view that contains only high confidence false positive model
    # predictions, with samples containing the most false positives first
    most_fp_view = (
        dataset
        .filter_labels("predictions", (F("confidence") > 0.8) & (F("eval") == "fp"))
        .sort_by(F("predictions.detections").length(), reverse=True)
    )

    # Retrieve the sample with the most high confidence false positives
    sample_id = most_fp_view.first().id
    view = dataset.select(sample_id)

    # Step 3: Send samples to Label Studio

    # A unique identifier for this run
    anno_key = "labelstudio_basic_recipe"

    label_schema = {
        "new_ground_truth": {
            "type": "detections",
            "classes": dataset.distinct("ground_truth.detections.label"),
        },
    }

    view.annotate(
        anno_key,
        backend="labelstudio",
        label_schema=label_schema,
        launch_editor=True,
    )
    print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))

    # Step 4: Perform annotation in Label Studio and save the tasks

Then, once the annotation work is complete, we merge the annotations back into
FiftyOne:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    anno_key = "labelstudio_basic_recipe"

    # Step 5: Merge annotations back into FiftyOne dataset

    dataset = fo.load_dataset("ls-annotation-example")
    dataset.load_annotations(anno_key)

    # Load the view that was annotated in the App
    view = dataset.load_annotation_view(anno_key)
    session = fo.launch_app(view=view)

    # Step 6: Cleanup

    # Delete tasks from Label Studio
    results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    results.cleanup()

    # Delete run record (not the labels) from FiftyOne
    dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)

.. _label-studio-setup:

Setup
_____

The easiest way to get started with
`Label Studio <https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio>`_ is to install
it locally and create an account.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install label-studio

    # Launch it!
    label-studio

Installing the Label Studio client
----------------------------------

In order to use the Label Studio backend, you must install the
`Label Studio Python SDK <https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install label-studio-sdk

Using the Label Studio backend
------------------------------

By default, calling
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>` will
use the :ref:`CVAT backend <cvat-integration>`.

To use the Label Studio backend, simply set the optional `backend` parameter of
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>` to
`"labelstudio"`:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    view.annotate(anno_key, backend="labelstudio", ...)

Alternatively, you can permanently configure FiftyOne to use the Label Studio
backend by setting the `FIFTYONE_ANNOTATION_DEFAULT_BACKEND` environment
variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export FIFTYONE_ANNOTATION_DEFAULT_BACKEND=labelstudio

or by setting the `default_backend` parameter of your
:ref:`annotation config <annotation-config>` located at
`~/.fiftyone/annotation_config.json`:

.. code-block:: text

    {
        "default_backend": "labelstudio"
    }

Authentication
--------------

In order to connect to a Label Studio server, you must provide your API key,
which can be done in a variety of ways.

**Environment variables (recommended)**

The recommended way to configure your Label Studio API key is to store it in
the `FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_API_KEY` environment variable. This is automatically
accessed by FiftyOne whenever a connection to Label Studio is made.

.. code-block:: shell

    export FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_API_KEY=...

**FiftyOne annotation config**

You can also store your credentials in your
:ref:`annotation config <annotation-config>` located at
`~/.fiftyone/annotation_config.json`:

.. code-block:: text

    {
        "backends": {
            "labelstudio": {
                "api_key": ...,
            }
        }
    }

Note that this file will not exist until you create it.

**Keyword arguments**

You can manually provide your API key as a keyword argument each time you call
methods like
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>` and
:meth:`load_annotations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`
that require connections to Label Studio:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    view.annotate(
        anno_key,
        backend="labelstudio",
        label_field="ground_truth",
        api_key=...,
    )

**Command line prompt**

If you have not stored your API key via another method, you will be prompted to
enter it interactively in your shell each time you call a method that requires
a connection to Label Studio:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    view.annotate(
        anno_key,
        backend="labelstudio",
        label_field="ground_truth",
        launch_editor=True,
    )

.. code-block:: text

    Please enter your API key.
    You can avoid this in the future by setting your `FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_API_KEY` environment variable.
    API key: ...

.. _label-studio-on-premises:

Server URL
----------

You can configure the URL to the desired Label Studio server in any of the
following ways:

-   Set the `FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_URL` environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export FIFTYONE_LABELSTUDIO_URL=http://localhost:8080

-   Store the `url` of your server in your
    :ref:`annotation config <annotation-config>` at
    `~/.fiftyone/annotation_config.json`:

.. code-block:: text

    {
        "backends": {
            "labelstudio": {
                "url": "http://localhost:8080"
            }
        }
    }

-   Pass the `url` parameter manually each time you call
    :meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>`:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    view.annotate(
        anno_key,
        backend="labelstudio",
        label_field="ground_truth",
        url="http://localhost:8080",
        api_key=...,
    )

.. _label-studio-requesting-annotations:

Requesting annotations
______________________

Use the
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>` method
to send the samples and optionally existing labels in a |Dataset| or
|DatasetView| to Label Studio for annotation.

The basic syntax is:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    anno_key = "..."
    view.annotate(anno_key, backend="labelstudio", ...)

The `anno_key` argument defines a unique identifier for the annotation run, and
you will provide it to methods like
:meth:`load_annotations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`,
:meth:`get_annotation_info() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`,
:meth:`load_annotation_results() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotation_results>`,
:meth:`rename_annotation_run() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_annotation_run>`, and
:meth:`delete_annotation_run() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run>`
to manage the run in the future.

.. note::

    Calling
    :meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>`
    will upload the source media files to the Label Studio server.

In addition,
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>`
provides various parameters that you can use to customize the annotation tasks
that you wish to be performed.

The following parameters are supported by all annotation backends:

-   **backend** (*None*): the annotation backend to use. Use `"labelstudio"`
    for the Label Studio backend. The supported values are
    `fiftyone.annotation_config.backends.keys()` and the default is
    `fiftyone.annotation_config.default_backend`
-   **media_field** (*"filepath"*): the sample field containing the path to the
    source media to upload
-   **launch_editor** (*False*): whether to launch the annotation backend's
    editor after uploading the samples

The following parameters allow you to configure the labeling schema to use for
your annotation tasks. See :ref:`this section <label-studio-label-schema>` for
more details:

-   **label_schema** (*None*): a dictionary defining the label schema to use.
    If this argument is provided, it takes precedence over `label_field` and
    `label_type`
-   **label_field** (*None*): a string indicating a new or existing label field
    to annotate
-   **label_type** (*None*): a string indicating the type of labels to
    annotate. The possible label types are:

    -   ``"classification"``: a single classification stored in
        |Classification| fields
    -   ``"detections"``: object detections stored in |Detections| fields
    -   ``"instances"``: instance segmentations stored in |Detections| fields
        with their :attr:`mask <fiftyone.core.labels.Detection.mask>`
        attributes populated
    -   ``"polylines"``: polylines stored in |Polylines| fields with their
        :attr:`filled <fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled>` attributes set to
        `False`
    -   ``"polygons"``: polygons stored in |Polylines| fields with their
        :attr:`filled <fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled>` attributes set to
        `True`
    -   ``"keypoints"``: keypoints stored in |Keypoints| fields
    -   ``"segmentation"``: semantic segmentations stored in |Segmentation|
        fields

    All new label fields must have their type specified via this argument or in
    `label_schema`
-   **classes** (*None*): a list of strings indicating the class options for
    `label_field` or all fields in `label_schema` without classes specified.
    All new label fields must have a class list provided via one of the
    supported methods. For existing label fields, if classes are not provided
    by this argument nor `label_schema`, they are parsed from
    :meth:`Dataset.classes <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.classes>` or
    :meth:`Dataset.default_classes <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.default_classes>`
-   **mask_targets** (*None*): a dict mapping pixel values to semantic label
    strings. Only applicable when annotating semantic segmentations

|br|
In addition, the following Label Studio-specific parameters from
:class:`LabelStudioBackendConfig <fiftyone.utils.labelstudio.LabelStudioBackendConfig>`
can also be provided:

-   **project_name** (*None*): a name for the Label Studio project that will be
    created. The default is `"FiftyOne_<dataset_name>"`

.. _label-studio-label-schema:

Label schema
------------

The `label_schema`, `label_field`, `label_type`, `classes`, and `mask_targets`
parameters to
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>` allow
you to define the annotation schema that you wish to be used.

The label schema may define new label field(s) that you wish to populate, and
it may also include existing label field(s), in which case you can add, delete,
or edit the existing labels on your FiftyOne dataset.

The `label_schema` argument is the most flexible way to define how to construct
tasks in Label Studio. In its most verbose form, it is a dictionary that
defines the label type, annotation type, and possible classes for each label
field:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    anno_key = "..."

    label_schema = {
        "new_field": {
            "type": "detections",
            "classes": ["class1", "class2"],
        },
        "existing_field": {
            "classes": ["class3", "class4"],
        },
    }

    dataset.annotate(anno_key, backend="labelstudio", label_schema=label_schema)

Alternatively, if you are only editing or creating a single label field, you
can use the `label_field`, `label_type`, `classes`, and
`mask_targets` parameters to specify the components of the label schema
individually:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    anno_key = "..."

    label_field = "new_field",
    label_type = "detections"
    classes = ["class1", "class2"]

    dataset.annotate(
        anno_key,
        backend="labelstudio",
        label_field=label_field,
        label_type=label_type,
        classes=classes,
    )

When you are annotating existing label fields, you can omit some of these
parameters from
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>`, as
FiftyOne can infer the appropriate values to use:

-   **label_type**: if omitted, the |Label| type of the field will be used to
    infer the appropriate value for this parameter
-   **classes**: if omitted for a non-semantic segmentation field, the class
    lists from the :meth:`classes <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.classes>` or
    :meth:`default_classes <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.default_classes>`
    properties of your dataset will be used, if available. Otherwise, the
    observed labels on your dataset will be used to construct a classes list
-   **mask_targets**: if omitted for a semantic segmentation field, the mask
    targets from the
    :meth:`mask_targets <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.mask_targets>` or
    :meth:`default_mask_targets <fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.default_mask_targets>`
    properties of your dataset will be used, if available

.. _label-studio-label-attributes:

Label attributes
----------------

.. warning::

   The Label Studio integration does not yet support
   :ref:`annotating label attributes <annotation-label-attributes>`.

.. _label-studio-loading-annotations:

Loading annotations
___________________

After your annotations tasks in the annotation backend are complete, you can
use the
:meth:`load_annotations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`
method to download them and merge them back into your FiftyOne dataset.

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    view.load_annotations(anno_key)

The `anno_key` parameter is the unique identifier for the annotation run that
you provided when calling
:meth:`annotate() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate>`. You
can use
:meth:`list_annotation_runs() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_annotation_runs>`
to see the available keys on a dataset.

.. note::

    By default, calling
    :meth:`load_annotations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`
    will not delete any information for the run from the annotation backend.

    However, you can pass `cleanup=True` to delete all information associated
    with the run from the backend after the annotations are downloaded.

You can use the optional `dest_field` parameter to override the task's
label schema and instead load annotations into different field name(s) of your
dataset. This can be useful, for example, when editing existing annotations, if
you would like to do a before/after comparison of the edits that you import. If
the annotation run involves multiple fields, `dest_field` should be a
dictionary mapping label schema field names to destination field names.

.. _label-studio-managing-annotation-runs:

Managing annotation runs
________________________

FiftyOne provides a variety of methods that you can use to manage in-progress
or completed annotation runs.

For example, you can call
:meth:`list_annotation_runs() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_annotation_runs>`
to see the available annotation keys on a dataset:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    dataset.list_annotation_runs()

Or, you can use
:meth:`get_annotation_info() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_annotation_info>`
to retrieve information about the configuration of an annotation run:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    info = dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key)
    print(info)

Use :meth:`load_annotation_results() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotation_results>`
to load the :class:`AnnotationResults <fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults>`
instance for an annotation run.

All results objects provide a :class:`cleanup() <fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults.cleanup>`
method that you can use to delete all information associated with a run from
the annotation backend.

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    results.cleanup()

In addition, the
:class:`AnnotationResults <fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults>`
subclasses for each backend may provide additional utilities such as support
for programmatically monitoring the status of the annotation tasks in the run.

You can use
:meth:`rename_annotation_run() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_annotation_run>`
to rename the annotation key associated with an existing annotation run:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    dataset.rename_annotation_run(anno_key, new_anno_key)

Finally, you can use
:meth:`delete_annotation_run() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run>`
to delete the record of an annotation run from your FiftyOne dataset:

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)

.. note::

    Calling
    :meth:`delete_annotation_run() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run>`
    only deletes the **record** of the annotation run from your FiftyOne
    dataset; it will not delete any annotations loaded onto your dataset via
    :meth:`load_annotations() <fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations>`,
    nor will it delete any associated information from the annotation backend.
